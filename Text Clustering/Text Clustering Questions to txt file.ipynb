       "['Emi Kuboyama here in Washington, D.C., with Aaron Zajic, May 17, 2019. So, Aaron, could you start by stating your name and giving us your role or title with the Office of Redress Administration?',\n",
       " 'And I understand that this was one of your first jobs after college. Could you talk a little bit about where you went to school and how you ended up in this role?',\n",
       " 'Do you remember who it was that interviewed you?',\n",
       " 'So when you first started, can you describe a little bit about the office structure? Who was working? Who was in charge? How the whole office was set up?',\n",
       " \"So we were in a building on 1333 F Street which wasn't, it was kind of more of a tall row of different office spaces. Were you there for that?\",\n",
       " 'So it had like five or six floors, it was an older building, and I think we had two of the floors. On one of the floors was the main processing, on the second floor was all the files, and I think it was the fourth and the third floor, I can\\'t remember because this was 1990. And we had our Special Verifications Unit, which, if anyone had any issues where it wasn\\'t clear cut, if we were looking at it and we weren\\'t sure that this was the same person because the names didn\\'t quite match or the date of birth didn\\'t match, we would send it to our Special Verification Unit which would do verification of more difficult cases that weren\\'t super clear cut. And when I first started, I was just doing mail. The program had already started in August of, I guess it started in 1988 after the bill was signed. And by the time I started, it was March of \\'90. So we were not making any payments yet, but we were processing lots of mail. And unfortunately, it had been so long, a lot of people had passed away but were alive in August 10, 1988, when the bill was passed, so they were eligible. Once they passed away, there was a series of triggers for how the heirs would come out. If a spouse was alive -- and I think the spouse was the primary heir -- if the spouse had passed, then there would be child heirs. In some cases, if the spouse had passed and there was no children but the parents were alive, the parents would be eligible. We did have cases where the parents were eligible as the heirs. So when a parent had passed, what my initial role was, was to match the mail up with a folder. If the parent had passed away and we got this information, then maybe we would send out a whole bunch of letters to all of the children. In some cases there was up to a dozen children. They wouldn\\'t all send it in at the same time, but this was, again, 1990, so we didn\\'t have some automated system with bar codes where we would scan them. They would go to the folder, and there was a guy that would get the mail and match it to the folder and hand the folder to an analyst for review. If the folder wasn\\'t there, he would just put \\'em in a bin. And as the bins were filling up, there wasn\\'t enough staff for someone to actually go and try to figure out what happened to all of the folders. So when I started, I had probably five or six bins of mail that I needed to catch up to the folders. And I ended up just spreading \\'em all on the floor and sorting them alphabetically and trying to match them with the folders. And sometimes the folders were back in the file cabinets by the time I got to \\'em, and in some cases they were still out on the floor with an analyst. So I would come in with a stack, \"Anybody got any of these five people?\" I would just yell out names. \"Oh, I got it,\" I would hand it out to them.',\n",
       " 'So it was just one big open space?',\n",
       " 'So did you ever reach out to the individuals directly? Did you pick up the phone and call them to verify any information?',\n",
       " \"So I'm trying to get a sense of, kind of, the size of the operation. You said at one point you were a team leader, so how many teams would you say there were and how many people were on each team?\",\n",
       " \"So the process... there was stage 1, I guess, I think we called it stage 1 or stage 2. I hope I'm not contradicting what others have said. But the mail would come in and certain research would be done in stage 1 just to totally verify that that person is the same person that we have historical records for. Once the historical research was done, and I believe that was the stage 1 team... are you nodding because that's right?\",\n",
       " \"Good. Then stage 2 would be my more administrative staff, I guess, and we were just making sure that now that we've identified that this is the same person, have they given us the right information? That they're still alive, because again, a lot of this unfortunately took so long for the bill to be signed and people were old, we needed to make sure that they were still alive, we need to make sure that it wasn't fraud, and that it was the right person, and that we had the specific documents on our checklist that we needed to make sure that we had proven that name changes, a lot of folks, if they were in the internment center, internment camps, and they were, got married afterwards, I needed a marriage certificate. And some people didn't have marriage certificates, so sometimes we had to work with our Special Verifications Unit to find some way to get witnesses or something just to show that there was a legal name change.\",\n",
       " 'So as the program progressed, how did your role change, if it did at all?',\n",
       " \"Well, as the program progressed, I was more of the team lead for the stage 2 analysts. As we got through the three, I guess it was two or three main... I guess it was three main payment sections over a certain amount of years, and it was just a humongous rush to get twenty-five or twenty thousand per year. Once we got through that, that was the majority of the folks. I don't remember exactly how many folks were determined eligible and given the formal letter of apology and payment, but I think it was, was it twenty-five thousand per year?\",\n",
       " 'Interesting. So I want to move on to talk a little bit about your recollections for certain key aspects of the program. What are your recollections around, the community outreach efforts? What was your role in it and how was that handled by the office?',\n",
       " 'Do you recall which cities you had a chance to go to?',\n",
       " 'Citizens League. Were they all part of the conventions or did you go on other occasions?',\n",
       " 'So were you there when they did the first check ceremonies?',\n",
       " 'Could you talk a little bit about what those were like and your involvement in them?',\n",
       " \"Exactly, exactly. So, actually, that brings to mind, so the ceremonial check presentations happened for that first round of payments, and my recollection is it happened in D.C., but it also happened in other areas of the country. Were you a part of, didn't they have a West Coast one?\",\n",
       " 'Can you describe that that was like?',\n",
       " \"Because people weren't supportive of the program?\",\n",
       " \"So for the people that didn't receive payment at these ceremonies, can you talk a little bit about, there's a check, there's a letter of apology, so how was that, were you involved with that?\",\n",
       " 'Yeah, and we had a lot of requests to say, \"Look I don\\'t want the money. It\\'s not about the money to me, can you just send it to the cancer society, or send it to some other charity in my name?\" and we couldn\\'t. We could just send it directly to the person and then they could do that.',\n",
       " 'Were you involved with any of the archival searching? Going to the archives, digging around for information?',\n",
       " \"Do you have recollections of particular individual claimants that you have anecdotes about that you'd be willing to share?\",\n",
       " \"So that's actually a great segue. I wanted to next talk about the personal impact that working at ORA has had on you. I mean, what would you say is the biggest impact in hindsight, having had the opportunity to work at ORA?\",\n",
       " 'So what would you say were kind of the biggest successes and biggest challenges of the office?',\n",
       " 'Well, to go back to the impact, after learning more about it, then as other things happened, September 11th, or other events, it would make you think, \"Oh, here we go again.\" And you would even, I would see news pundits also bringing up the Japanese American internment as other issues would come about and saying, \"Are we not going to learn from our past mistakes?\" So that was a big impact to me about just sort of remembering the past and how could this awful thing have happened, and how could we possibly even start heading that way again?',\n",
       " \"I'm curious, do you talk to your kids about that?\",\n",
       " \"I have one, I talked to him about that, and how we judge people. I guess, even, to us, September 11th doesn't seem like that long ago. I have a fourteen year old, it was way before he was born. But I did tell him about the program, and as Jewish people, we also think about the Holocaust and what happened there, and then what's happening in current politics, sort of makes you... I don't want to get too political. Just makes you think about how... so we discuss that at the dinner table, about how important it is to not let these types of things happen again. So I interrupted you, what was the next question?\",\n",
       " \"No, no, I was just going to say... are there any other people whose contributions you want to mention? I know that you know who else I'm interviewing with, but are there others that you just recall having had an impact that I might not have been set to interview?\",\n",
       " 'Was Val before Tink?',\n",
       " 'What were your recollections just about the office and the people that worked there?',\n",
       " 'So now, are many of those contractors, did they have the opportunity to stay on with Justice after redress was over?',\n",
       " 'So if you had to summarize kind of what your biggest takeaway from the whole experience was, or the impact on you would be, what would you say it would be?',\n",
       " 'Is there anything else you want to add about anything related to redress?',\n",
       " \"So today is Tuesday, July 7, 2009, and we're in Torrance, California, at the Holiday Inn in a hotel suite. And on camera we have Dana Hoshide, and the interviewer, I'm Tom Ikeda. And so, Aiko, I'm going to just start at the very beginning. Can you tell me when you were born?\",\n",
       " 'And were you born in a health facility or with a midwife, do you know?',\n",
       " 'Okay, good. And when you were born, what was the name given to you at birth?',\n",
       " 'Any middle names or anything like that?',\n",
       " 'Good. Before we talk about your father and mother, can you tell me your siblings kind of in birth order so we can have that?',\n",
       " 'And generally between Frank and Aya, Ei, Johnny, what was the age difference between everyone?',\n",
       " \"So let's talk about your father next. Can you tell me his name and where in Japan he was from?\",\n",
       " 'And do you know anything about his family, what they did?',\n",
       " \"Oh, that's interesting. You mentioned, sort of, half sisters. So was your father married in Japan and had children?\",\n",
       " 'Your mother, what was her name and where was she from?',\n",
       " 'Well, and so how did your mother and father meet?',\n",
       " 'I never knew that. I asked my father one time, and he said, \"I called over the mountain and she came.\" [Laughs] That\\'s the only thing I know. And it was, my mother apparently had been married before. And it was probably hard for a woman who had been married once before to be remarried. But it was interesting that when I was divorced, my mother chastised me for bringing embarrassment to the family. And then, many years later, I found out she too had been married before. So I confronted my mother, who was a sweet, gentle soul, one of the sweetest women I ever knew. And I said, \"How come you got on my case for having been divorced?\" And as little Japanese as I understood, I was able to understand this much from her. She said, \"Well, in those days, way back in the end of the 19th century, we didn\\'t have things called divorce. So my then-husband didn\\'t get along with my mother. And so he just walked off into the sunset and I never saw him again. That\\'s the same as a divorce, but we didn\\'t have to go through this messy court stuff. So it\\'s not the same as you divorcing.\" [Laughs] \"Okay, okay, Mom, I got it.\" That was so funny.',\n",
       " \"That's interesting that you didn't know, and I'm guessing the community didn't know that she had a previous husband?\",\n",
       " \"I think they didn't. I don't think anybody did. 'Cause apparently, that marriage didn't last very long. There were no children. And I guess my mother's mother was pretty tough. It was a yoshi case, what is it, when a man comes and marries into the woman's family instead of vice-versa and takes the family name, that woman's family name and drops his own last name, right?\",\n",
       " 'Right, and that was the second husband or the first husband that was yoshi?',\n",
       " \"And what was... oh, that's right. Going back to your mother's family, what kind of work did her family do?\",\n",
       " \"Okay. So this is interesting. So your father had three children, and he's recently married to your mother. And at that point, they decide to come to the United States?\",\n",
       " 'And do you know what he found in America, where he settled?',\n",
       " \"Yeah, that's a good idea. So when you were born, you mentioned earlier you were born in Sacramento. So your father was doing different things, and I wanted to ask, what was your father like? I mean, he's doing these different things, you described him as sort of scholarly. What kind of personality did your father have?\",\n",
       " 'Well, he looked stern, but he wasn\\'t. He just had that \"I\\'m the boss\" kind of look, but he was not. And never laid a hand on us, and just his demeanor, if he was displeased, would be very sharp and stern. But (...) I think I was spoiled. I\\'m pretty sure I was. But he, unfortunately, because of the language barrier, I didn\\'t communicate with him too much. He knew English, he spoke some English, he read a lot of English, but he didn\\'t communicate in English very much. And my mother didn\\'t -- so busy taking care of all of us kids that she had no time to go like women often do now. She was... and of course because the economic situation being so poor in the \\'30s, early \\'30s and all, she didn\\'t make time or take time to learn English. So, of course, that\\'s one of my biggest regrets, that my relationship with my mother was so brief in terms of our being able to communicate. I fault myself a great deal for not appreciating my mother more by not embracing the opportunity to learn Japanese. So I keep thinking now, even this late day when I\\'m pushing eighty-five years old, how was I able to communicate and develop any kind of relationship with my mother when we hardly talked? We did the best we could with her poor English, with my poor Japanese. But she was a devoted mother. And so, always so kind, sweet and gentle. Loved music, she was a good shamisen player, she played the koto, she loved to dance the odori, mostly Bon Odori during the summer months. And it was a joy to see her do that because she worked so hard all the time.',\n",
       " 'And how about her relationship with her husband, your father and mother? How would you describe that?',\n",
       " \"Sort of what I figured was typical of Issei parents, that Papa was the boss, Mama did all the work, and he had the last word. But my father was not stern that way, so I think she might have had it a little easier. He was not a bossy type. I think... isn't that strange? I don't remember a lot of the communication between the two of 'em, they must have had their own private moments.\",\n",
       " 'Okay. So you were quite young, but do you recall kind of the differences between Sacramento and Los Angeles when you went? Was it quite a bit different or about the same?',\n",
       " 'And how about things like school? Was that about the same, from Sacramento to Los Angeles?',\n",
       " 'When you look at your school, so elementary, junior high and high school, what were, like, the percentage of Japanese Americans in your schools or your class? Do you remember?',\n",
       " 'I wanted to ask you about community events when you were growing up. Did you participate in Japanese community events in Los Angeles?',\n",
       " 'I wanted to go back to those clubs, and especially the boys. When you had all these different clubs, did they ever get into fights or anything like that? Was there that kind of competition?',\n",
       " \"How about the girls' clubs? Did they ever compete against each other in different ways?\",\n",
       " 'Now, in your club, the Junior Misses, did they have, like, different positions of authority? Like a president of the club and things like that? What was your -- the question, I guess, what was your role in the Junior Misses? Did you take a leadership role? Were you like a leader of the Junior Misses?',\n",
       " 'In my notes, I have listed that you also spent a lot of time dancing. Can you describe your dancing, what kind of dancing you did?',\n",
       " 'Well, did your other siblings get the same opportunities to do music lessons or dancing lessons?',\n",
       " 'As a family, did you ever play together, music, like around the piano and sing together?',\n",
       " \"Now, when you would go to your friends' homes, or other relatives, and they had, on holidays, did you hear the same kind of singing that was in your home, or was your house maybe a little different?\",\n",
       " 'How large was the church in your growing up experience? I mean, how important was church to you?',\n",
       " \"So during this time, you were doing things like dancing. And I'm just thinking of popular culture, which was very sort of white dominated. And the kind of movie stars and dancers you mentioned were white, and you wanted to be a dancer. And it seemed to be, perhaps, a very conflicted or confusing time for you to be in this larger popular culture, but yet being Japanese. Can you talk a little bit about that, sort of how that felt for you?\",\n",
       " 'And when you say \"resentful,\" who were you resentful towards?',\n",
       " 'Yeah, so in this kind of climate, how did you, what did you feel about being Japanese? Was it something that you viewed as a positive, a negative? I mean, how would you view being Japanese?',\n",
       " 'Do you recall your parents ever, or other relatives talking about Japanese and what that meant in a prideful way about being Japanese?',\n",
       " \"Or maybe certain expectations that because you're Japanese, you should act a certain way?\",\n",
       " \"And how did those values come through? How do you find out that you're supposed to be the best you can be, you don't bring shame? How does that happen?\",\n",
       " 'During this sort of growing up in Los Angeles time period, were there any individuals that you viewed as role models, or really helped you out in terms of advice that you can recall? Someone you looked up to during this time period?',\n",
       " 'Somebody that I looked up to... in the Japanese community?',\n",
       " 'No, it could be a teacher, it could be anyone, an adult that you thought... or maybe some even older, a little bit older, that perhaps mentored you or helped you in any way?',\n",
       " \"So I'm going to switch gears here now and go to December 7, 1941. And at this point, you were still a high school student. But can you describe that day for me in terms of how you heard about the bombing of Pearl Harbor?\",\n",
       " 'My best recollection of it was that we had, I had just been at a party, and we were going home in one kid\\'s car, and the radio announced it. We just couldn\\'t believe it; we were sort of in a state of shock, and thought, \"Well, this must be a farce.\" But when we got home, my... I think it was my father, my brother said, \"Did you hear?\" And then my neighbor, who was Japanese, we got together and said, \"Just can\\'t believe it.\" It was such a shock. And at that point, it was just shocking. Didn\\'t think until a day or two later, the effect of it, what this meant for us as Nihonjin. Of course, that came soon enough afterwards. But it was unbelievable. We knew that there was a connection between what happened and us, simply because we were Japanese, but we had no idea the extent of the damage that would be done to us as a community.',\n",
       " 'And so, for instance, like the next day, when you go to school, did anything happen that indicated that, \"Oh, this is going to be different\"?',\n",
       " 'Well, like at school, did the administration or teachers do anything either positive or negative to influence how the community looked at Japanese Americans?',\n",
       " 'Now, how did the principal tell the Nikkei or Japanese American student that they were not going to get, they were not going to graduate?',\n",
       " 'It was. And at that point, I was mad at Japan. [Laughs] \"Why did you put us in this position?\" you know. \"I didn\\'t choose to be born Japanese, but here I am now because of what you did, Japan. Look what\\'s happening to us.\" So I was really angry at Japan for a long time because of that. But I figured, I didn\\'t know at that time. Of course, now that I know more about the causes and effects of Pearl Harbor, I fault this country more.',\n",
       " \"During, when you find out that the families, the Japanese American families are going to start being removed, what did you do during this time period? In particular, I'm thinking that you had a boyfriend during this time period. Can you tell me what kind of things were going on for you?\",\n",
       " 'Oh, yeah. Well, we were all looking for specific instructions and facts. And, of course, the army, government, really didn\\'t know what it was going to do at that time, making decisions on the fly. And with General DeWitt and all those details we didn\\'t know about until we started doing the research, of course, forty or fifty years later. But most of us just spent our time worrying about what\\'s going to happen. At first, I thought only our parents, as aliens, would be affected. I never dreamed at the very beginning that, oh, we\\'re American citizens, this is not gonna bother us, even though we had some social pressures on us. But eventually, of course, it turned out that all of us would be affected in some ways, and we spent our time worrying about, \"Well, what are we gonna do?\" In my particular case, we didn\\'t know until quite a bit later, probably in February or March, that in Los Angeles, where there was such a large community of Nikkei, that we would be divided into certain areas and be sent somewhere. None of us were told where. I really felt that maybe they\\'re going to take us out someplace in the desolate area and shoot us all. I really thought that they might do that. So there was a lot of fear. Maybe other people didn\\'t feel that, but I thought, \"Why would they be sending us away unless they\\'re going to do something bad?\" So there was this kind of fear, at least on my part.',\n",
       " 'then I had the personal thing. At that time, my boyfriend was living on the east side of Los Angeles, and here I was on the west side. And when we were told that we\\'d all be sent to different places, I panicked. And I thought, \"Oh, my gosh, I\\'ll never see this boyfriend again.\" And so when it came time, pretty close to time to go, as a matter of fact, only a few days before, we ran away and got, we eloped. I falsified my age, I was seventeen but I said I was eighteen. He was already nineteen, I guess, then, couple years older than I was. So that way I was able to go with his family wherever they were gonna go. Of course, that devastated my family terribly because they, my father did not, I think, did not want me to hook up with this young man. Because my father -- oh, he had a thing about every time I got a new boyfriend, he would say, \"Is he going to go to college?\" [Laughs] And I had no idea whether or not Jake was going to go to college, I said, \"I don\\'t know.\" \"Well, you\\'d better pick somebody who\\'s going to go to college.\" [Laughs] So when the time came, and the community in that particular area of Los Angeles, the Boyle Heights area, had to go to the train station, I joined, the night before, joined Jake and went with the family to Manzanar.',\n",
       " 'Going back, before we go to Manzanar, so your parents must have been upset about the, about you marrying Jake and eloping. And how about your brothers and sisters? What was their reaction?',\n",
       " 'Now, would this, going back to that date, would this have been sort of out of character for you to have done something like this?',\n",
       " \"Now, in retrospect, do you feel like, perhaps, this was, for you, a rushed decision? Something that if it weren't for the war and the camps, that this wouldn't have happened?\",\n",
       " \"Okay. So you joined your husband's family, and you go to Manzanar. So why don't you describe what Manzanar was like for you?\",\n",
       " 'Oh, well, when we got there, as you know, it was such a desolate area so far from civilization, I thought, that I said, \"Oh, this is where they\\'re gonna shoot us. Nobody would know the difference.\" That was my immediate reaction when I got there. But then, there were so many of us, that we just took comfort in the fact that there were a lot of (us) in the same situation. And just seeing the living arrangement was, it was a real bummer. Thinking that, wow, this room has one light bulb. [Laughs] And there were seven of us in one small room. I think it was sixteen by twenty feet: me, my husband, his brother and his wife, newly married, too, Jake\\'s older sister, her husband, and a little baby. So there were six and a half of us in this one tiny room. Of course, they gave us our little separate spaces later on, but it was several months before that took place, maybe, not quite a year. But it was not very comfortable for newlyweds, especially, or any family, to live that close, not have the privacy. Which is the thing... I think liberty and privacy is what I miss the most. Not being able to just walk out to the corner drugstore, get an ice cream soda, or the privacy, not being able to change your clothes when you wanted to. Of course, we all put up little partitions later, as you know. (...) We had three different families in one room. The guys put up slats and then put a blanket, nailed a blanket to separate our living quarters. And since it didn\\'t take me long to get pregnant, it was difficult because the bathroom was in another building, no running water. So it was hard; it was hard. And at that time, I was aware that my mother was not well then, so how was she going to manage and how where they going to manage her food? No cooking facility, how are they going to manage toilet? Yeah, it was a hard life, especially for the ill and the infirm and the old.',\n",
       " 'And so you mentioned being pregnant and delivering. What were the medical facilities like for a woman going through pregnancy and giving birth to a child?',\n",
       " \"Because we lacked the kind of nutrition that we know about today that would be best for a pregnant woman, I guess, in retrospect, I think we lacked the kinds of foods, particularly, that would have been helpful to produce a healthy child. Not just that, but the fact that if there's no running water, little things like rinsing out diapers, soiled diapers, was a big problem. Washing three dozen diapers a day in a tub with a washboard, like there's no washing machine. For the pregnant woman like me, the food was not the best, I think. So I think most of the children who were born in camps like my daughter, had, at least the first growing up period, they were not really healthy. They didn't have the immune system developed that worked in if we had had better food. The hospital was run by a doctor, who I heard later on, not at that time, but later, from people who worked in the hospital, that the white doctor was an alcoholic. And most of the work was done by Nisei nurses or some Nisei doctors, who, as you know, were paid the highest wage. Was it nineteen dollars a month? Oh, boy. Teachers, doctors, nineteen dollars a month, to do the kind of hard, hard work that was required. And I don't know, not having associated myself with hospital facilities, if they were, had the kind of equipment or supplies that a normal outside hospital would have had. I know in the case of my father, in Jerome, when I went to, transferred to Jerome, there (weren't) enough flashlights. For example, the night before he died, Christmas Eve of 1943, he had an oxygen tank to keep him alive, and we were not permitted to light candles or something because of the danger of explosion, and the electricity was out. There was a... what is the word for it when the electricity was...\",\n",
       " 'A blackout?',\n",
       " 'And do you have a sense, was there like a, very many other mothers giving birth about the same time? Were there quite a few births happening?',\n",
       " \"But how was it for you? Because you're seventeen, eighteen years old, you're pregnant and delivering a baby. Most of your friends, same age, didn't have that life. I mean, they were maybe finishing high school or going to the camp dances, things like that. How did you deal with that? Were you frustrated about it or what did you think about that time period?\",\n",
       " 'In terms of your family in Jerome, did they correspond? Did you write letters back and forth?',\n",
       " \"So that seems unusual or somewhat harsh that they wouldn't let your husband go with you. Here you're a family unit, husband, wife, child, asking to be transferred, and they separated you. They treated you more like, still, your previous family, there's this kind of division. Do you know why the government did that?\",\n",
       " \"So, Aiko, where we left off from the first section was you had just returned to Jerome because your father was deathly ill. And you arrived with your newborn child and you. I'm curious, what was the family reunion like when you got to Jerome?\",\n",
       " 'And what did he die of?',\n",
       " 'And what about the rest of the family? What was the reception for your mother, your sisters, your brothers?',\n",
       " 'And how did you know they forgave you? What happened?',\n",
       " 'How about discussion? Was it ever discussed what you had done?',\n",
       " 'I was going to ask, in terms of comparisons between Manzanar and Jerome, what were some of the differences between the two camps?',\n",
       " 'And do you have a sense in terms of just the... what\\'s the right word? In terms of the tension -- I know Manzanar, especially in those early days, there was some unrest, I mean, there was some, they call them the \"Manzanar riots\" for instance, and things like that. And I didn\\'t hear as much about Jerome in terms of unrest, and I was just wondering in terms of just the community attitudes, if you had a sense of any difference between Manzanar and Jerome.',\n",
       " 'You mentioned how your husband Jake eventually joined you, but then you said he went into the army from there?',\n",
       " 'Okay. And so what service did go to?',\n",
       " \"Well, he went to Camp Blanding, and then he was sent to Germany. But he never talked about it, so I don't know if it was part of the 442 or where did the Nisei who were trained in Camp Blanding; were they integrated into the 442? Do you know? I'm not sure.\",\n",
       " \"But now I'm thinking about your relationship. I mean, here you got married, you eloped right before you went to Manzanar, then once you got to Manzanar, there was no privacy, and then you became pregnant and had a child. And then you were separated from your husband because you went to Jerome to be with your sick father for several months. And then he comes just for a short time and then goes to the army. So what happened to the relationship? It seemed like it never really had much of a chance.\",\n",
       " 'And when were you in Japan?',\n",
       " 'So let me see if I can summarize this. So from Jerome, you went directly to New York?',\n",
       " 'No, from Jerome I went to, while Jake was still in Germany, I went to Denver, Colorado for several months, because part of the Miyazaki family, my in-laws, were living there. They said, \"Come out here, \\'cause it\\'s nice in Denver.\" So I went to Denver, but I just didn\\'t dig it. I just wasn\\'t comfortable, I didn\\'t care for it. And so I said, \"No, I think I\\'ll just pick up, go back to California.\" And without any, it just shows how stupid and non-thinking, and didn\\'t consider the future. I just picked up with Geri and a few suitcases and went to, came to Los Angeles without even knowing, when I left, where I was gonna sleep when I got here. [Laughs] And by sheer coincidence, when I reached here and I checked into a hotel, Geri. (...) I decided to go to the Relocation (office of) the War Relocation Authority relocation office, to see what available facilities I could look into, apartment or something like that. And on the way, I met one of my in-laws, and he said, \"Hey, what you doing here?\" I said, \"Well, I decided to move from Denver to here.\" He said, \"Where are you going to stay?\" I said, \"I don\\'t know, I\\'m just going to find out.\" \"Then come home with me, and we\\'ll put you up.\" Holy Moses, what luck. I had, born with a silver spoon in my mouth, I thought. Well, they were so kind to me and they took me in, and I was one of, I think, twenty-one in a three-bedroom house. We took turns, as I recall, sleeping, eating. But this family was so generous and wanted to help way beyond the call of duty. This sister-in-law of mine and her husband had three kids. They had Ted\\'s father, mother, brother, and a daughter, and two brothers and me and Geri. I think there were about twenty, twenty-one of us. And we just made do. I don\\'t know how we did it, but they were amenable, friendly, respectful of each other. Imagine. All one related family. Such generosity. He said, \"Come home with me.\" [Laughs] I\\'ll never forget that.',\n",
       " 'And what did you do in Los Angeles during this time?',\n",
       " 'Oh, I first went to, with the blessing of my sister-in-law and her husband, they said, \"Okay.\" I said I wanted to go to a stenotype institute. At that time, before tape recorders became the easy way to record things, the stenotype institute taught people how to use this very condensed, abbreviated typewriter-like (instrument), where you had to learn the combination of keys for the missing keys to take dictation or to take speeches at conventions, which I learned to do. And I was working to take speeches at conventions, or get hired out from this institute to a letter shop, where I would be rehired by, say, lawyers who worked in that building to take dictation and do temporary work. That was the first time I had direct experience with a guy. I went with my stenotype instrument, walked into his office, and he looked at me and he said, \"Are you the temporary secretary?\" I said, \"Yeah.\" \"Are you Japanese?\" \"Yeah, my parents are from Japan.\" \"I don\\'t want you. Tell your boss to send me someone else, not Japanese.\" I was shocked. I had never had somebody tell me right to face, because I\\'m Japanese, \"I\\'m not going to use you.\" Didn\\'t know what I could do, what I couldn\\'t do. I was really devastated at that. Well, I took this course and I graduated, so I got some work as a court reporter, but I never had to go to court. I went to conventions (like) Veterans of Foreign Wars conventions, (or taking) dictation and things like that, and then transcribing them. So I did that for a while until Jake came back from Germany, and then we split. So I moved to New York, back to my family again with Geri.',\n",
       " \"And then so you're in New York for about how long before you go to Japan?\",\n",
       " \"To '49?\",\n",
       " \"Boy, I'm guessing that was a big shift for you, to live in Japan?\",\n",
       " 'And what are some memories from Japan?',\n",
       " 'How about other Japanese Americans? Were there very many other Japanese Americans that you got to know?',\n",
       " 'In Japan?',\n",
       " \"And so how were these years for you? It was like four or five years you're in Japan, was this a good time for you?\",\n",
       " 'Yeah. Well, it was sad in a lot of ways because it was sad to see the country and its people deprived of so much. By the time, when we first went there, it was still, the country was still reeling from the aftereffects of the devastation, and there were little kids with no shoes walking hadashi, barefoot, (...) and people with not enough food or clothing. But by the time we left, 1954, it was just amazing to see how much the Japanese had picked themselves up and took advantage of the opportunities (arose) whenever it appeared. And they really pulled themselves up so fast from the bootstraps. I compare that with the European countries that were so negatively affected by World War II, how long it took them to come up from all this devastation, and how quickly the Japanese did. They became one of the economic powers, right, in twenty years, thirty years? While Germany and all those other countries were having to struggle. That made me very proud, you know, when I think back. It was... I enjoyed that, certain parts of it. I didn\\'t like some of the Americans who went into Japan as conquerors, and they let the Japanese people know we\\'re here because \"we beat you.\" And that kind of attitude really bothered me. There were a few Nisei who were like that, and I didn\\'t like that very much.',\n",
       " \"So I'm curious, when you saw like a Nisei or someone else act that way, did you ever say anything to them?\",\n",
       " 'Oh, no, I never did. I was chicken. But I thought about it a lot and said, \"Gee, why did he have to talk like that to this houseboy or this salesperson or something like that?\" as if he was the almighty. And it just made me unhappy. I tried to avoid people like that, because it made me just uncomfortable to be with people like that. But I didn\\'t learn that the best thing to do is to speak your mind right away until much later, and I decided, be more honest and upfront with people, yet try to be tactful. [Laughs] It\\'s a fine line, I think.',\n",
       " 'Now, earlier, you mentioned how quickly Japan sort of recovered. Why do you think Japan was able to recover so quickly compared to the European countries?',\n",
       " 'And you really saw that in those five years that you were in Japan?',\n",
       " 'And so any other ways that you were changed by being in Japan those five years?',\n",
       " 'So then why did you come back to New York after five years?',\n",
       " \"Now, what was your second husband's name?\",\n",
       " \"And then New York, and then you have three children, and you're now back in New York. And so what do you do in New York?\",\n",
       " 'Okay, and so, and coming back to New York, and then it sounded like you went back to school or something? I guess maybe that was where...',\n",
       " \"Yeah, '54 now, what happened?\",\n",
       " 'And how was it that you could, what were the children doing during this period?',\n",
       " 'And about what years were these? What year was this?',\n",
       " 'When was that?',\n",
       " 'Yes, it was. And it was the first time I had such close contacts with blacks. It was only, the office where I worked was only a block or two from where Mary Yuri Kochiyama lived. And, of course, we were involved anyway, starting with AAA then. But it was such a wonderful experience for me to be able to relate to the blacks, and to understand what they meant when they said, \"I wake up in the morning and think, \\'What kind of shit am I gonna face today?\\'\" You know, just to be, understand their feeling. Whereas it was a good experience for me to get to live among them for so many hours a day.',\n",
       " \"And so how, I'm curious how you got this job. Because here you're kind of in your early forties, you're a Japanese American, and this is right after a lot of racial unrest in places like Harlem, and you're now right in the middle of that. I mean, how did you get that job?\",\n",
       " \"And so it feels like... what's the right word? It feels like you're awakening to something new?\",\n",
       " \"Can you talk a little bit about that? What's awakening in you?\",\n",
       " 'And would you say that that was the core, or the main reason that really got you more aware of these things, AAA?',\n",
       " 'And then married and went down to D.C. But I guess the first question is how did you meet Jack?',\n",
       " 'Well, actually, I met him in Japan. It\\'s interesting that you ask that. [Laughs] Because he, Jack happened to belong to the same CIC unit, the Counterintelligence Corps unit that my then-husband belonged to, which was headquartered in Kyoto, but the sub-branch was in Otsu, where we lived. And so we used to see a lot of each other during that time, and we were all friendly. We used to join each other at the officer\\'s club and have dinner at each other\\'s homes. Then when Jack and his family left Japan in the summer of \\'54, and just at that time, we were transferred from the Kyoto area to Nagoya. So we were in Nagoya from early spring or summer to the end of \\'54, December, when we came back to the United States. And we had exchanged, our families stayed in touch, we exchanged Christmas greetings and things like that. But, and then all of a sudden, in 1976, when I was in New York, living in Manhattan, I get this call from Jack saying, \"Hi, this is Jack. I\\'m downstairs.\" [Laughs] So how many years? Twenty years or... \\'54, \\'64... yeah, twenty-something years had gone by. \"Oh, Jack. Okay.\" So it turned out that he had separated from his wife, and eventually his wife passed away anyway, she was very sick. But it was twenty-something years, and we picked up the... there was something right about, there\\'s, nothing happened in Japan, but all those years, we just sort of stayed in touch. And it was, so it seemed like, \"Oh, haven\\'t seen you since yesterday,\" kind of feeling. I think when the chemistry is right, that kind of feeling prevails. So it was that many years. [Laughs] We decided to get married. \\'Cause I\\'d been, by that time, I\\'d been separated for fifteen more years or so, longer than that, when Davis said he wanted to get remarried, so can we be divorced? We had been separated the umpteen years. I said, \"Sure.\"',\n",
       " 'And so when you got married to Jack, how old were your children at that time?',\n",
       " 'How old were they?',\n",
       " \"This is '76, okay, 1978 is when we got married. Lisa was born in '51, so what does that make her?\",\n",
       " 'And David?',\n",
       " \"Right. And you're, at this time, fifty-three years old, about fifty-three?\",\n",
       " 'Or fifty-four? Fifty-four. And so what do you do in D.C.?',\n",
       " 'Oh, right, okay. Well, Jack was still working when I first started doing archival work, but then he did retire, so he wanted something to do. So I asked him if he would pick up on the archival work searching for information for the Commission on Wartime Relocation. And so, oh, he was very happy to do it. And the more he learned about it, the more incensed he got at his own country. And he got -- I might have mentioned this in a previous interview, but he became incensed at the idea that here he was in his paratroop role, paratrooper role, fighting the enemy, Japan, for our constitutional guarantees, the freedom, liberty, equal opportunity, equality under the law, and at the same time, we were being mistreated, we American citizens. And the more he thought about it, the more he thought, \"Gee, we were fighting for principles, and I lost so many good friends, fighting for principles that we were not living up to ourselves.\" And it just made him so mad that he got into this archival research of an injustice against the Japanese American community like a bulldog. So he helped me dig out things. I would ask him to look at certain records that I didn\\'t have a chance (to see). He would look it up, and we would Xerox these copies to give to the Commission, so that they could come up with their recommendations (to) Congress. Then we were asked by the National Council for Japanese American Redress, William Hohri\\'s group, to do research for them because they were planning to file a class action lawsuit. So Jack helped me on that, because I was tied up with the Commission office a lot. So he helped me to pull together the things that would be helpful to the class action lawsuit. Then the coram nobis lawyers said they could use some help, too. So Jack helped me, and we tried to help the coram nobis cases do the research. And just about the same time, the Smithsonian was planning to open up its exhibition on Japanese Americans. What was it? \"A More Perfect Union: Japanese Americans and the United States Constitution,\" and they asked me and Jack to be consultants on the content of the exhibition. So we were busy helping the curator on that. Then after the bill was passed for Civil Liberties Act of 1988, the Justice Department asked Jack and me to be the consultant on locating all eligible people for redress. So we were involved with that, to especially locate (and verify names) of people who applied for redress but (whose) names weren\\'t on official records. We were able to direct the Justice Department to the master list, which was the most useful one, listed everybody who was in the ten camps, and those who were in the internment camps, which was different, of course. So we were able to locate rosters and names of those who were in the internment camps. And especially for people who applied, but whose name didn\\'t appear, they asked us to find. So Jack was involved with me every step of the way.',\n",
       " \"I'm now going to switch gears. I'm not going to ask you questions about your archival work because it's well-documented in other places, especially the, I think what you call were the nuggets that you found as a researcher like the first edition of DeWitt's Final Report would be an example of that. But it's been pretty well-documented that your, the work that you did was really important to not only the coram nobis and also the redress, but just in terms of uncovering lots of information that was really helpful to scholars about what really happened during World War II. And I'm just curious in terms of your role and how you, when you look back at it, you had such a pivotal role. What do you attribute that to? I mean, why were you the person who was so key in finding so much?\",\n",
       " 'But let me, let me make sure I understand this. \\'Cause when I talked to some of these others, they said in terms of constructing the story, but it wasn\\'t like they were trying to construct the story, and then they called you, Aiko, and said, \"So, Aiko, can you find this document or this document?\" it was more of a matter that you uncovered things that were really powerful, and then had enough knowledge to say, \"Oh, this is probably important,\" and you then gave it to them. And it was this really rich source of materials that they said, \"Oh my gosh, with this material, we can now construct the story.\" I think, wouldn\\'t you say that that was the case, more?',\n",
       " \"But when you think of the work you did in terms of the... I look through the reports and things, and the enormity. I mean, I've been in archives before, and it's not a nice and tidy type of work. I mean, it's opening boxes, looking through things, and it's so easy to miss something or not look at something, and realize the importance of it. It is almost like looking and finding the needle in a haystack sometimes in terms of looking at this. And I'm wondering, in terms of what happened especially in the '80s, with the coram nobis or redress, I mean, it's pretty clear to me, without some of these key documents, it would have been very difficult to have made the case. How, as a community, how close were we not to finding some of these documents? I mean, how, I mean, when I listen, I talk to Peter Irons sometimes, he says, he'll call it outright luck sometimes.\",\n",
       " 'That when he met you and his example of getting lucky, and how lucky were we as a community that all these pieces came together?',\n",
       " 'I think so. I agree with you, and that was why I took it upon myself to do what some people call unnecessary extra work. But I documented everything I got exactly where it, what file, what box, what record group and everything else, so that when the Commission wrote its report, people couldn\\'t say, \"How can that be?\" Here\\'s proof officially written by top government, top government, here\\'s proof. So it took a lot of extra time on my part, and I know people were saying, \"Oh, you\\'re just so piddly about details.\" But that helped to augment and strengthen the report so people couldn\\'t deny it.',\n",
       " 'I mean, was there ever times when you thought that this work would have been part of an effort to, I guess, in some ways, recover over a billion dollars in redress payments, overturn Hirabayashi, Yasui, Korematsu? I mean, were those things kind of going through your mind when you were doing this kind of research?',\n",

The coram nobis cases, where, as you mentioned earlier, they vacated the convictions of Fred Korematsu, Gordon Hirabayashi and Min Yasui. So did we accomplish that? Are we, did we make... I guess the question is, is that enough? I mean, did we accomplish, did you and others accomplish what they were after?',\n",

Not just 9/11 and the aftermath of Guantanamo and all, but going back to our situation. Even though we have had the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, compensation and apology, just the fact that it happened again in terms of Arab Americans who were deprived of the same kind of rights that we were. I really don't think it's... I don't know if it's not possible, but I would like to see an international tribunal put the United States government on trial and go over some of these misbehavior that the government has been involved in, to see what the international court would say about what the United States has done in terms of its minority groups. I wish that this were a possibility. I think that they've been talking about it after the Iraq situation, they've been talking about an international court in terms of Guantanamo alone, I think, but not the administration's actions. But I think I would like to see if there is a possibility to have an international court look at the situation that the United States has prostituted its principles for other self-aggrandizement goals of either individuals or groups in the United States. Think that's a dream?\",\n",

       " 'wouldn\\'t you know, the first march I ever did in Greenwich Village, they had a picture of the march, quite a large picture, and who is in the picture in the middle of the picture? Me. And I thought, \"Oh-oh. Wonder what is my family is going to say?\" Sure enough, my family was not very pleased, the rest of my sisters, siblings -- not very pleased with what I was doing. They were a good, quiet Christian family, wonderful people, but they thought I was always very hard to handle, and here I go again. Black sheep of the family, involving myself in activities that would be frowned upon by the rest of the community, most likely. And my sister very quietly let me know that she thought, \"What are you doing? Don\\'t you know what you\\'re doing is going to affect the rest of us? How do you think I\\'m going to feel when I go to church?\" That kind of quiet pressure. But it... they realized that that\\'s just not going to stop me, because I felt that I was, what we were doing was right. But it was an experience. I learned from these people because they were just full of the world in their heart. All these people in the Triple A, I learned so much from each member, and I would say, as I started to say earlier before this interview, that they turned my head, my thinking.',\n",
       " 'that, I\\'m sure, had the most effect -- my connection -- on starting to think about our own experience back in wartime, and why did it happen, and what we were suffering from as a result. I never really thought that much about it. In the first place, of course, I was raising children and it was pretty busy. Survival was the main concern right after the war. But it was, the Triple A experience is the thing that triggered my becoming what some people call activist. The Triple A had also instituted a program, an annual program to commemorate Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings. That was a great thing, I thought. You know in New York City, what we did was, started with the churches, and said, \"Can we, can we use the church for just a program?\" And I think the Japanese community, as small as it was in New York City, looked a little askance at this group, because of the kinds of issues they, they were interested in, and because, particularly because of the lack of hesitancy to protest publicly about many government actions. And because my family was so closely associated with the church there for so many years, and since I had been a member of the church, it was a little -- we got access to the church a little easier because the good, connection with my family. And through that, though, you know, we were able to recruit a few people who belonged to the church, and saw the righteousness of their (AAA) objectives in dealing with some of these problems, at least to talk about it, to try to understand it, and then protest if necessary.',\n",
       " 'The Asian Americans for Action continued to do its work. I remember being, recall the Native American Affairs and remember meeting Ted Means, Russell Means\\' brother. Oh, and that was when I think Peltier was arrested and we were trying to help to get a fair trial for him. We involved ourselves in various issues. I remember Zimbabwe, Rhodesia -- that was one of the issues. One of the leaders, of course, was Mary Yuri Kochiyama, and she, of course, had so many connections. She met everybody from the whole world and I remember she brought, I think it was Robert Mugabe\\'s brother to one of the meetings to talk about the problems before Zimbabwe was turned over to the natives -- this was, they were under colonial control. But you can see the wide range of activities in which we got involved, and had, of course, largely to do with the Iijima\\'s family and Kochiyama family and Minn Matsuda, primarily those three. Because so many of the -- a number of the members that were, not recruited because there was no recruiting going on -- but came from the Christian church -- there was a real nice connection, that they were able to take back some of the messages to the church, about oppression in other countries, to people who worked at the headquarters at the Methodist or Presbyterian church in New York City. If they heard about some of the things happening in Triple A, they could take the message back to the headquarters, and make people in the church, in the international division or wherever, aware that -- \"How about paying some attention to these subjects?\" So it had subtle, but far reaching consequences, I think, that Asian Americans for Action\\'s activities generated.',\n",

       " 'I went to the National Archives, and I was quite surprised at the amount of information that they had about me. But then when I think back, yes, when we went into camp, we filled out all kinds of forms. And so why shouldn\\'t they have this, but I was surprised they kept it. Little old inconsequential me? But they kept everybody\\'s papers: school records, dental records, medical records, letters that went in and out of camp. They kept everything and they ended up putting them in individual folders for each person. If you were a child, your papers may have ended up in your mother or father\\'s folder. But, and sometimes there were individual folders I know for children, too. I remember seeing some drawings, report cards, things like that. However, as I started to do this work for myself, my family, looking up records, the archivists there said, \"Do you know there is some wonderful records about this camp experience in the archives, and there\\'s not enough people looking at it, it\\'s so interesting. Would you like some help to find it?\" Well, sure why not, I have the time.',\n",
       " 'think they had a tremendous influence on Congress, the legislators to consider the legislation, passing the legislation. We spoke to congressmen and especially in the House, we spoke to Barney Frank after the bill was passed, long after at a social event one time. And we asked Mr. Frank, \"Can you tell us, now that it\\'s all over with, what you think was the effect of the class-action lawsuit on the bill, the redress bill?\" And he said, \"There\\'s no question about it.\" Why? Because at the time they voted that bill -- this is to be understood, the timeframe is very important -- the time the Congress, House voted that bill, the Supreme Court had not yet come down with the decision on Hohri. I think the Supreme Court was waiting a little bit to see what Congress would do. [Laughs] And Mr. Reagan, President Reagan signed the bill in August 1988. Supreme Court denied hearing Hohri in October. By that time, I think they figured, Supreme Court Justices figured, \"Well Congress has voted them, the Japanese Americans an amount, $20,000 per survivor or heirs, so why do we need to hear this?\" But I think they were actually, I think they were little afraid to hear it because the opening up and going to trial -- an open trial of Hohri vs. U.S. -- would have brought up a discussion, definitely, of the validity of Korematsu, Hirabayashi, you know, all those cases. They would have had to look at it again and say, and talk about the constitutionality question, which had never been addressed by the Supreme Court. Even in the wartime cases, the Supreme Court of those, of 1944, did not address the constitutionality question of exclusion and incarceration. They addressed curfew, they addressed the law, when military regulations that said a Japanese person must report for quote \"evacuation\" we call it exclusion. They addressed this thing about curfew with Mr. Hirabayashi, however, they never tackled the constitutional question.',\n",
       " 'of the things, for example, that I did not mention during the session, that Mr. McCloy objected to was that the report said Japanese Americans were removed from the West Coast because no matter how long it took, we would never be able to determine whether or not they are loyal to the United States. Now, Mr. McCloy said, \"Now if that is not a racist, bigoted statement, what is?\" And Mr., General DeWitt\\'s statement also said, \"Well, we had to, we didn\\'t have time to separate the sheep from the goats.\" That put us in a such a category, sub-human nature, even Mr. McCloy objected to that. The other thing the statement said was that, \"We want to keep these people, anybody with Japanese blood, 1/16th Japanese blood, in these camps for the duration of the war.\" And as I mentioned yesterday, Mr. McCloy was horrified at that idea, because he wanted to clean out the camps right away, as soon as possible. He wanted them to be relocated outside the military zone and to start homes elsewhere because by the end of the war he did not want some conditions comparable to Native Americans\\' reservations, having Japanese American reservations that the government would be responsible for taking care of, and he was determined the camps be closed as soon as possible. But, he was trying to give General DeWitt some respect as a commander, however, this was just too much for him to take, and he was not pleased about the report.',\n",
       " 'so he said to Colonel Bendetsen, \"I thought you were going to show me this report and let me approve it before you issued it.\" And he said, Bendetsen said, \"Oh, don\\'t worry, there\\'s only ten copies of these we printed.\" He said, McCloy said, \"Bound, already finished?\" Colonel Bendetsen said, \"Yes. And we made arrangements with the printer that we\\'re going to have more copies made but I wanted to show you what a finished product looked like.\" So, well, Mr. McCloy was totally unhappy with not just those three or four things I told you about, but many other parts of the report. And so this began a series of memos and telephone conversations between the West Coast and the War Department in Washington as to the nature of the changes, the words to be changed, the phrases to be knocked out. And I knew that this had taken place because I saw a file. And I saw the file which included -- after the corrections were made and the newer version was printed. There was a warrant officer who was charged with making sure that anything having to do with the original version of the final report be destroyed, including galley proofs or everything.',\n",
       " 'I\\'ve been asked by people who said, \"Are they hiding things?\" I said, \"How do I know they\\'re hiding things, unless I know what I\\'m looking for and I can\\'t find it.\" I have a feeling, there was a question in the plenary session saying yesterday, \"Was something done on purpose, do you think the government was hiding something on purpose?\" I think that was the nature of the question. And I don\\'t think so. I don\\'t think if -- maybe there\\'s something that our National Security Agency is holding back, perhaps. But in terms of our history, of our Japanese American history, I have never felt that there was anything really being hid. I\\'ve seen documents that are saying, \"This document was removed from the file for security purposes.\" But usually you can trace those somehow, you can trace them back.',\n",

She herself played the shamisen, the three-stringed instrument that looked like a banjo. And also, the koto, the thirteen-stringed instrument. She, I think my father, also, although he was not musical, he appreciated, he loved it. He loved to have music in the house. I feel the rest of my brothers and sisters were also quite musical. I had an older sister who sang, played the piano. Another sister who played the piano. My brother, older brother played a violin. So all of us were able to do something in the music line. When we bought the piano, I tell you, the house was so happy. Of course, my family was very Christian so the first compositions played were always hymns, were the hymnals. I think that perhaps I should mention here, at the time that we were removed from our homes, we had to sell the piano for next to nothing, I think it was something like ten dollars, including all the music. It was a heartbreaking experience for us.\",\n",

       " 'When the attack on Pearl Harbor occurred, I was at a party of my high school friends, and it was, we were just shocked. It was hard to believe that this had happened. Of course, at the mom-, at that time, we didn\\'t know how it would actually affect us, but we knew it would be affecting us in some way. The party broke up, we all went home. And I think our parents took it much harder because, as you know, as most -- perhaps a lot of people don\\'t know -- that persons of Japanese ancestry who were immigrants were not permitted to become American citizens at that time, in 1942. This didn\\'t change until 1952, ten years later, when they were finally permitted to become American citizens. My father and mother had been here a number of years, but by law, they were, could not become naturalized citizens. So, of course, we were concerned as to what would happen to the immigrant parents who were considered aliens. And of course, as soon as the war broke out, they were considered \"enemy aliens.\" If the immigrant was from either Japan, Italy, or Germany. He automatically -- he or she -- automatically became an enemy alien. We did not think -- at least I didn\\'t, and I think many of us who were second-generation Japanese, Nisei -- didn\\'t think much about what would be happening to us. We were concerned about our parents. We thought we were American citizens, therefore we were protected. We were protected by the Constitution to continue to have the freedom, the liberty that we, all Americans have a right to. I didn\\'t know directly what happened to many of the older Japanese men who were apparently picked up by the FBI agents and immediately, following the war, placed in jails. My father was not one of these who was picked up because he was not a community leader. He was not a teacher of Japanese language schools, he was not a Buddhist priest, he was a little, a small businessman. And so we were spared the shock that many families went through when their fathers were abruptly taken away from their homes and jailed, simply for being an \"enemy alien,\" not for any crimes that they had committed. So when we -- yes?',\n",

       " 'Oh, all right. Many families owned their homes, so they had a lot more problems in terms of their economic situation and property. We were so poor, we didn\\'t own the home, we were renting, so that, that was not as big a problem for us. Our problem was what to take, what to destroy, what to sell. And the neighbors, the persons, the non-Japanese who were not moving, being asked to move, knew that the shorter time we had to leave, the more willing we would be to lower our prices. So there were \"vultures\" all around, hanging around for days, waiting for the day that we would move, and that we would literally have to give things away. My mother, of course, had some small items, beautiful little dishes from Japan, and I think some heirlooms that she decided to sell -- brooches, obitome -- things like that that I, I know that she had to get rid of, to sell, because she felt we must take what is absolutely necessary as long as we were permitted to take only what we could carry, at the time. And I have heard many stories of mothers who were so furious at the insulting prices that were offered by buyers, that they rather, rather than sell them at these prices, they would break the dishes or the big platters that they cherished so much. I believe those who left for the camps early on did not have the opportunity, or the knowledge at the time, or the permission by the government, that they could store some things. That kind of information came later on and those who moved into these army-run assembly centers later on, say, June, July, they were told that they could store some things. So many of those families were able to keep household goods, furnitures, where those of us who left very early could not do that. I myself -- yes?',\n",

       " 'Okay. When I was going to high school -- this was Los Angeles High School -- we lived during that time in a very hostile environment, hostile to ethnic Japanese. There was a strong feeling of hostility against people of Japanese ancestry. Therefore, we had difficulties going, buying homes in certain areas, and this anti-Japanese feeling carried itself over into school. When the war broke out, after Pearl Harbor, as a matter of fact I think it was about a month after Pearl Harbor, I was reminded by one of my classmates a few years ago who came up to me and he said, \"Don\\'t you remember that Principal So-and-so called us\" -- we, of Japanese ancestry, who are ready to graduate that summer -- \"called us into his office and said, \\'All of you don\\'t deserve to graduate. Your people bombed Pearl Harbor.\\'\" We were in a state of shock. He said, \"Don\\'t you remember?\" I think I pushed that in the back of my mind and just tried to forget it. He had never forgotten it. He was bitter all these years, this friend of mine. The Japanese American students tried their best to be the best citizens, worked two hundred percent harder than everybody else, because we were always under scrutiny, disliked, so we were out to prove that we were just as good, if not better than the quote, \"mainstream\" students.',\n",
       " 'Did you ever get a diploma? Did you ever get your diploma?',\n",
       " \"Okay, so now let's jump back to where you're about to have to leave for the assembly centers. So what, what happens?\",\n",
       " 'Yes, okay. I think you, we were talking about how we decided what kind of clothes to take. What did we do about our personal property? Since we were not told exactly where we would go, it was hard to decide, do we take summer clothes, winter clothes? Sneakers, boots, or what? So I found what few things I selected were totally inadequate for the kind of weather that we finally did encounter when we went into camp. At the time, I mentioned to you a little while ago, that I was engaged to a young Nisei who lived on the other side of town. We found out that the persons living in the area where he lived would be going to a particular assembly center, whereas my family would be going somewhere else. And so foolishly, and desperately in love, we eloped, so I could go with his family. That is what I did. So I ended up in a camp called Manzanar where my parents did not move for another month or month and a half, they did not go to the same camp. They went to another camp called Santa Anita. It was a horse racetrack, and it was a pretty miserable situation in which they found themselves. Not that Manzanar camp was much better, but it was at least not horse stables.',\n",

       " \"Manzanar was, of course, a desert, and all around us was sagebrushes. There were mountains way, way beyond, east and west of that area. There was no way that anybody would even want to escape from the place, because the nearest place was so darn far away, and besides, if you're Asian and you escape, you can't melt into the crowd. I mean, it's ridiculous for anybody to think they could escape and be, go undetected. The area was known for... what do they call it? Dust storms where it looked like a tornado, shaped like an upside-down cone. We were besieged by these dust storms day after day after day. The summers were desperately hot and winters were quite cold. The ill, those persons who were ill, the people who were senior citizens, and mothers with little infants, the infants, these persons were the ones who suffered the most because of the unavailability of water in the barracks, the unavailability of food, immediate, which was of such importance.\",\n",

       " 'Yes, that\\'s right. Isn\\'t it funny? I didn\\'t think too much about it. Sears Roebuck and Montgomery Wards were two large stores that probably made a whole lot of money on the Japanese camp residents. We read those two catalogs from the two companies like Bibles. I think I remember memorizing what page the chocolate candies were on in the Sears Roebuck catalog. What page the diapers were on, or the, all those necessary things were, in the Montgomery Ward catalogue. We bought diapers -- during those days there were no Pampers or Huggies. We bought diapers through the catalog. Baby clothes, layettes. Of course, it was something. I remember going through these books and thinking well, this costs three dollars, we only get sixteen dollars. How much of that -- what do we have left for the rest of the month? Fortunately, we didn\\'t have to pay rent, or buy our meals, but everything still cost the same for us as for people who lived outside of the camps and they were making a hundred dollars a week -- or maybe not that much -- a hundred dollars a month as opposed to what we were making, sixteen dollars a month. It wasn\\'t easy. I remember being pregnant and saying, \"I\\'ve got to have this box of chocolate,\" and order it, wait for two or three weeks, anticipating every day a box of chocolate, and then a notice coming, saying, \"Sorry, we\\'re out of stock.\" I remember crying and crying when that happened.

I don\\'t know why I was looking all over the place.\" I managed to understand that much of what he was trying to tell me. And he, he went rather peacefully. But I do recall something that I think my, my Christian family would be not too happy to hear: that just before he died, he was giving a chant, like the Buddhist chant -- I don\\'t know the proper word for it, but it sounds like, namyohorengekyo, something like that. And I thought, \"Here\\'s this Christian man, what is he doing, coming out with this Buddhist chant?\" It was some childhood memory surfaced, either that or he, he believed that we all, regardless of what religion, we all worship a god and that no matter what house of worship you go to, whether it be Buddhist, Catholic, Protestant, that we are just taking different roads to the same destination. Maybe that\\'s why it was no problem for him to be chanting a Buddhist sutra, chant, and still be singing hymns in the next breath. He was a remarkable man, I think.',\n",

And I know that he was affected. So, yes, I guess it is possible that his, he became a little depressed as a result of the incarceration and the unfair treatment of the people. That, of course, meant how would it affect... there was such a question, how was it going to affect the rest of us? His children, after the war was over. He had such high hopes for all of us to be able to go to school, to become, make something of ourselves. So I think it weighed heavily on his mind, the fact that this camp experience would be a horrendous barrier to our future. I guess most of us were, since we didn't know what was going to happen, were worried that we might all be put on a ship and sent to this strange country of Japan we had never been to.

There was a lot of worry because there was a lot of confusion, and the confusion reigned even among the administrators of the various camps, I believe. The effort to get this questionnaire was actually started in Washington, D.C. in order to determine how many men would be eligible to serve in the armed forces. Actually, it sounds, it doesn't sound like a logical, logical reason, but there was an effort by the War Department to find out how many Nikkei, Nisei, and Kibei men would be available as fillers for -- not fillers -- to, to establish a combat team.

So, but he would try to help them or ask, because of his status as going to the villages to help the injured, that he would have access to the certain villages. So he would ask, \"Where are you from?\" \"Can I check your family?\" and things like that. So those are the things that we heard about him, his last moment from survive, the student. So of course students are probably all in their seventies, eighties by now. So I don\\'t know where they are or we\\'ve never found out any more detail. Of course, we never found the body or remains. Southern part, when they had a severe land bombing from the air, they hit all these sugar cane field area. That\\'s where the southern part of the island, they had a big sugar cane field.

They were all drafted as a nurse. And their symbol is Himeyuri, the lily maiden. And they were all trained or used as nurse at that time, so that's... and they were always with these medical corps group. And, of course, the young boys, students from, at the end, from junior high on, they were all taken as soldiers.

But of course, there were people that were being killed. But tombs, there\\'s the stone walls, doors that you can close. But sometimes if you have it open, my grandfather told me, he said he was sitting by the entrance, there was a gentleman sitting next to him, and the bullet came and shot him right there.

So like end of \\'40, or something to do with the war, bombing was done in \\'41? Was it, Pearl Harbor was December, right? So you could not be in that year. It was, I don\\'t remember, but it was something that you have to be a year before, something like that. And so she had to alter, and then she came on her... my mother had U.S. passport, so she came on her passport. But again, my, I have a friend who was born in Okinawa, and she and her sister both were born in Okinawa. But her, both parents were U.S. citizen, but then were like first ship that came out. And the whole family came, and she had, they had no problem. But I think her father was, had somehow with the U.S. government connection. But they were also in those repatriation act or whatever, that the U.S. granted the people with U.S. citizen the right to return to America. And so my mother was born, so she was one of those. And they were, they were some of her, a few of her high school classmates, that they were born in America and they were all, like, sent to Okinawa to go to school. They came, and I believe there were three or four ships. And my mother was second from the last ship, so I don\\'t know if that\\'s second or third ship that she came. And, but they were mostly, they were all to Hawaii. But, except for one... yeah, some people came to San Francisco, from Hawaii to San Francisco, but I don\\'t know how that ship worked.

She said, \"Oh, is that how Okinawans look?\" So at that time, yeah, I guess lot of young people, Japanese thought Okinawan was some foreign country.

So to me, was it like a, those refugee camp like we had? But it was much later that I learned about camp and how the Japanese were all being put in there. That was, that was a, really a learning experience. But yeah, we had... at that time, Roosevelt had lot of Japanese, so lot of Sansei kids that I grew up with. So I had a normal high school, junior high, high school life as a regular Sansei.',\n",

I mean, this is after, it was going on from before, but so like our part as the children was, main help was at the picnic time, or, well, shinnenkai was as we got older. But because I was dancing, so as a part of entertainment, we always participated in picnic and shinnenkai. And picnic was, you know, you would, the parents, mothers, would be cooking from night before, bento, big bento, enough to feed whole army. [Laughs] And they\\'ll take it, and everybody has goza all next to each other, everybody\\'s sharing their food. I mean, it was, it was a big deal. And the carpenters, members who were carpenters, they would go from five o\\'clock in the morning and build stages. And the person who\\'s in charge of the drinks get a big tarai, all that tarai lined up with ice and water. So you have to make sure that each one, only one, so that they don\\'t come back, everybody would have it. So it was, yeah, it was actual stage and dressing area in the back, covered, and the musician area on the side. So they all built that on that morning, and then take down in the afternoon. So, you know, after those people that\\'s able to do that, we just, the young people just couldn\\'t keep doing that. But the past two years, we\\'ve been having those mobile stages that we borrow, and do it at the Legg Lake Whittier Narrows park now. And Elysian park, for the parking, you have to park all on the street, and the children had, all the children had their games in the back. So it was, the little kids that went there, they still remember that as an adult, that\\'s what they remember. So they write to OAA, \"Why can\\'t we have those kind of picnic?\" So we have to explain to them, \\'There\\'s nobody to build stage, there\\'s nobody to go and work from that time.\" If you want that, come and volunteer.\" So we\\'ve been pretty successful for the past few years. Yeah, those were the times that, mainly, that I would get involved in that OAA function.',\n",
       " 'Do you think the fact that Okinawa was so devastated during the war, do you think it tightened the community here, also?',\n",
       " 'I think, I think so. And then, and also, they were so far away from main Japan, so that in itself, I think, if you look at the name, \"Oh, you\\'re from Okinawa?\" \"You\\'re not from Okinawa?\" \"You\\'re Okinawan?\" You recognize right away. So I think those two is the name. And then Okinawan music and dance in itself, again, is a little different from Japan. So I think that plays a part of, yeah, cohesiveness of the community.',\n",
       " 'Now, is it because of your involvement with the kenjinkai that you started to continue in your dancing?',\n",
       " 'No, not really with the community, but my interest became more deeper because, again, here they didn\\'t have any formal teacher, so I thought, \"Oh, since I\\'ve started, why don\\'t I continue?\" So I just took that opportunity to go. But again, the community itself, music, sanshin group, they helped me. Like when I was in high school, they would all pitch in to send me to Hawaii and so I can learn, and, of course, I have to come back and show them what I\\'ve done and commit myself to perform and things like that.

You know, it\\'s easy for me to say now that our Constitutional rights were violated, I wasn\\'t thinking of those things at that time. It was a shock to say, you know, to know that we had to leave by reason of race. But then I didn\\'t think deeply enough to think about those things then. There was kind of almost a resentment of, \"Why were we born Japanese that we\\'d have to leave like this?\" And so, thinking of unfairness, it was almost like we were turning it against ourselves, saying, you know... we wished we didn\\'t have to leave, but we had to leave because of our ethnicity.

I\\'m not criticizing people, but it\\'s just that it was a different atmosphere for our family, as it was for some other families. But I was... most of the people were accepting of what had happened, and they didn\\'t turn their sadness into real bitterness, which was very good. But you know, I think that was part of the culture also. And so often people say, \"Well, why didn\\'t you protest?\" And there\\'s lots of criticism by younger people, and other people saying, \"Well, you didn\\'t have to go, you should have protested.\" But it wasn\\'t the time to protest, and it wasn\\'t that kind of a, you know, atmosphere.

Curt reported it immediately, and luckily if you\\'re a GI, your property cannot get sold. And the apartment was in my brother\\'s name, because, you know, my parents could not own it. And so he was able to save the apartment from being sold, but all the furniture had disappeared and the money had gone and everything. But the apartment was still there, and Curt was able to take care of it until he was drafted into the service.
