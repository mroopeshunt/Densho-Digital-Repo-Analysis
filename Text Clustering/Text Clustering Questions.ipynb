So after you went to Camp Savage, what happened to your brothers?', 'Okay. Were you able to communicate with your brothers?', \"So what did you think? I mean, why didn't it bother you?\", 'And what, how would you know? I mean, you were trying to see whether or not they were telling the truth or a lie? Or what were you looking for?', 'And so with that information, you could, you would find out quickly if that soldier knew anything?', 'But in between those stories, he would tell you, sort of, military information, and that was useful?', 'Did you ever, after the war, were you ever in touch with any of the men that you questioned during the war? So after the war, did you ever meet any of them again?', \"I'm curious about, did you interview or interrogate very many officers, or was it mostly just infantrymen?\", 'But how did you feel the first time you saw her and she was sort of mean to you, asking you what side?

Can you tell me your father's name?\", \"Oh, so let's talk about, I was going to ask, so first, what was your mother's name?\", \"So you mentioned she was going to night school, and that's where she met your father.

Like, you know how writing groups now where sometimes they'll read...\", 'Okay. And then when they finish writing, what did they do? Did they just go home or did they stay around and talk?', 'And how frequently would they get together?', 'But before the war, did you have any, any jobs?', 'You know, in thinking about your father... so before the war, how did people treat him? What was his position in the community?', 'And before we go there, what about you? When you found out, what were your thoughts?', 'And how about the people around you, your friends, the family? Do you remember...', \"How about the feeling? I mean, so people are in their homes, kind of clustered, what's the feeling?\", 'Did anyone talk about, \"Wow, I wonder what\\'s gonna happen, or if anything\\'s gonna happen to us?\" Or your parents or anything like that?', 'When your father was picked up, were you home when that happened?', 'And what was your, the reaction of your father, when this was happening?', \"You don't remember. Do you feel, do you remember what you felt? Were you frightened or...\", \"So when your father didn't come back right away, how did you find out that, where he was?\", 'Do you think they did that because they knew that your, the family needed, needed help?', 'Okay, good. How about, during this time, during the war, were there ever any problems with the other ethnic groups? You mentioned the Portuguese, the Chinese, the Filipinos...', \"So where there ever any incidents that you can recall, that maybe didn't happen to you or the family, but maybe others, or other parts of the island, that you heard of?\", 'So going back, yeah, so when some families, like for instance, if someone, like a son, volunteered, did that family sometimes come under pressure from other families, like, \"Oh, you shouldn\\'t do that\"?', 'Okay. When martial law happened, what impact did that have on people? What changes?', 'And so how did that impact you when you think about your life? What were the big changes for you?', 'I see. And did that happen when you went, you know, did the plantation work, that the money you made was to help the family?', 'And during this time, what was your, what was the, what was your mother like? I mean, did she...', 'Did you ever get a sense that she was concerned about your father, or did she just not talk about it?', 'Oh, you read... so what did you know, then, about your father?', 'And then at what point did the family start getting letters from your father?', 'But when he was on the mainland, what was your sense from the correspondence that you did get from him?', 'Do you recall the type of things that you wrote to him?', 'So just, can you recall, when you first saw him, where you were? Did you, like, meet him at the docks?', 'What about his demeanor? I mean, what was his, was he..', \"So the haiku club didn't meet anymore. But how about just friends in general? Did people come by, did you see any of that after your father was back?\", 'So when your father came back, he wrote a couple poems, haiku, about his experiences.

Other than those poems, did he share much later about his experiences?\", 'How about things like your family, like your mother? Did you see any changes?', \"So how did that make you feel? I mean, there's some sense of responsibility being the first --\", 'And did you start doing things like dating and things like that?', 'So did that surprise you? Is that something that you had not known about?', 'And then during that time you got married?', 'So how did you meet your husband?', \"And so he wanted to get to know you better. So what's your husband's name?\", \"So how did, I'm curious, how did the two, how did he court you? How, what was the dating like?\", 'How long did you date before you decided to get married?', 'Okay, so just a couple years after you graduated. And then how many children do you have?', \"And why don't you just, why don't you just give me their names?\", 'Okay, good. Anything else you want to talk about? I finished all my questions. Is there anything that, like that something that happened maybe during or after the war that, that you want to talk about?', 'Is there something you want to talk about about that, or anything that you learned?', \"Oh, by that time they're small, right?

At the end of the day, how did you feel about that? Was that something that you really felt good about?', 'And so you did this for two years, and then after that, what did you do?', 'Well, as an example, you mentioned earlier the issue for redress in terms of individual payment versus group payments. So there was a, people had different opinions about that. Did people sort of coalesce around that, and is that kind of an example where you saw, perhaps, the most divisions in terms of what side people were on?', 'And what was the thinking? Because eventually they came around to doing individual payments. What was the thinking?', \"And who's willing to say there was a lot of backstory? Lot of backstory, whoa.\", 'And so I want to ask that. So when you found out that your dad was arrested for curfew violation, what did he say when you asked him about that?', 'Do you think the group knew what it was getting into when you guys were early on meeting, what it was gonna be like to do this?', 'And how did that go over with people?', 'And where did \"Betty\" come from?

Did you ever go out and maybe go swimming?', 'How about your mother? Did you do much with your mother?', 'How about outside the family? Did you have, like, playmates that you...', 'And who... was there anyone there to greet you?', 'Now were the two families close? Did they know each other?', 'So you and your sister would go to your grandmother?', 'So were you a little bit homesick or sad?', 'So you thought that maybe their lives were hard life to make them look so old?', 'Now during this time, before the war, did you get letters from your family?', '[Laughs] You always asked that in your letter?', 'And how about your sister? How did she like living...', 'How about your grandmother? Did she like having you and your sister living with her?', 'So you said you lived with your grandmother for nine months?', \"Okay, and this is your auntie on your mother's side?\", 'So what was your aunt like?', 'Now after your grandmother died, I\\'m thinking, why didn\\'t your parents say, \"Come home back to San Jose?\"', \"And then you stayed with your aunt. Now, why didn't they send you with the teacher, too?\", \"But were you there maybe, I think, three years before the war started? I'm trying to remember... you were eleven, so that'd be 1930...\", 'Did the, maybe... now, the police officer, your friend, knew that you were American. Did he ever say anything to you?', 'How soon did you... when the war started, was it right away or was it maybe a little bit later?', 'Now did any of the workers ever get killed?', 'Now did you still see your aunt very much during this time, or did you live at the factory?', 'Oh, so your friends, your friends were there?', 'And so what happened to your brother? Did he have to go into the military?', 'But when you heard about the bomb, what did you hear? Was it like a special bomb, or did you know how bad it was?', 'Well, in the days after the atomic bomb, did you see any of the victims?', \"And so, okay, so your younger brother was in the occupation, and what was it like when you saw your younger brother? Because you hadn't seen him for a long time.\", 'So when they said, when your girlfriend said that she was scared, what was she scared of?', 'So many of, some of the girls started going out with Americans?', 'And how hungry were people? How bad did it get?', 'And how would the girls meet the Americans? Were there like special places to meet?', 'So she wanted to keep you away from the Americans?', 'Now in his letters, did he ever talk about what happened?', 'But that would be during the war, right? After the war he could say anything.', 'Now why... this is after the war, right? Why would they do that after the war?', 'How about your sister? Did she do the same thing?', 'And what did your sister do for the army?', 'And then your brother, what kind of work did he do?', 'Twenty-one. So what was life like that for you? Was it a good time?', \"Okay, so tell me when you first when saw your, you were reunited with your mother and father, how was that for you? Because it's been a long time.\", 'How about your mother and father? Did they look different after all those years?', 'And there were just the two of them that lived there?', 'Now how about your other brothers and sisters? So did your sister come back to America?', 'Now going back to your story, when you came back to San Jose, did you ever see some of your old friends from before? Before you left, like classmates from school?', \"Now, why didn't you ask them? [Laughs] They didn't ask you and you didn't ask them, how come?\", 'So how did you start going around? So one year later, what happened? Did he ask you for a date?', 'So is that good or bad, having four sisters?', 'So, Peggy, can I ask you just quickly about your children? So how many children...', 'How did that get arranged? Do you know, or...?', \"You don't know if your father had any connection with your mother's family, and that it was arranged by relatives or anything like that? It was simply arranged?\", 'Then did your mother work?', 'Who did you stay with, when both of your parents were working? Who was taking care of you?', 'Just two families in the house?', 'And not particularly eventful during that time until the war was approaching. As a youngster you would have been what? Nine years old?', 'As those times were approaching, what kind of an impact did they make on you as a nine year old?', 'How did you understand what was happening here, that these things were going on? What did your parents say to you?', 'You don\\'t remember being involved with your mother while that was going on in terms of seeking to find out, \"What\\'s wrong Mother?\"', 'Do you remember the feelings? Were you scared or... confused or...', 'How did they enforce that?', \"Yeah, that's right. That's more common than the other way around, isn't it? Where the woman...\", 'What was it like living in those crowded conditions, under those circumstances?', 'Was she working at getting you married?', \"She wasn't looking for prospects or having her friends look for prospects?\", 'How did you work that out, though, if I may pry a little?', 'And how did you finally get married? Without her help?', 'Is there anything else we ought to know, that people might some day wonder about, that you know now?', 'So now, do you know how you got that name, how, how your parents came up with that?', \"Okay. So yeah, now I'm going to probably refer to Mom and, our father was always called Daddy, right?\", 'So how did that come to be, that we always called him Daddy? Is that...', 'Baachan.

And tell, and can you tell us how many people were, how many children she had?', 'And Auntie Taneko was her, where was she in the order of her children? Maybe you could give us the names of all of her children that survived?', 'So how did you find the historical records?', 'After, after his first wife passed away?', 'And so it was our father who kind of, was he the one who kind of helped with that business as well?', 'But his father, whose name do you know?', 'I see. And do you know how he died?', 'And his younger siblings, did they work for him?', 'I see. So whatever this business that, do you remember what he did, what our dad did originally when he came here, before he started this business?', 'It was afterwards, so she came by herself?', 'Amazing. And where did she, and what happened? She lived with us, right, for many years?', 'And how did she pass away? She was young, right?', 'So she was older. But yet still very, very young, right, when she passed away?', 'I see. So the oldest, oldest sisters ended up taking care of the younger children. And when you, what elementary school did you go to?', 'Right. So the people that you met when you were in Boyle Heights, many of those are still your friends, right? Do you still have...', 'So when you, when you were very young what memories do you have of Daddy and his business and what he did in, while we were living in Boyle Heights?', 'We were very close to their family.

So tell me, what was Ben like?', 'So you were kind of like the mother, then, for Tommy?', 'So I guess -- we just went through all your siblings -- and I guess one question I just have to ask is, did you ever ask your mother why she had so many children? Or was that pretty common for other families to have...', 'Well, do you think they wanted to have this many children, though?', 'And were those pretty close together?', 'And how did your father meet your mother? Yoshiko, do you know how they met?', \"And I should ask, your father's name was? What was your father's name?\", 'You just did it. [Laughs] Eiko, how about you?

When you think of those days in the '30s before the war, growing up, what are some of your memories?\", 'And so the girls would play football with the boys? You would just all play together?', 'I should have kept a diary, huh?', 'And about how old were you when you had to go out there, and when you say you played more, about how old were you?', 'Would they also teach other kids or just your family?', 'And so how many girls were there in that room?', 'So how many bedrooms are in that house?

This was long after the war, you mean, she did this?', 'What year was that? Because my brother sold it, and then they had an agreement that my mother was able to stay in that big house until she passed away.', 'And then you would come home, and did you play for the family, the two of you?', \"I think they closed it, didn't they?\", 'Yoshiko, after December 7th, when you would go to school, did you notice any differences in terms of how people treated you?', 'And what do you mean you felt bad?

I think there were some other families that he helped, too.\", 'And so you lived there for a while, and then you were saying, what happened next?', 'And for the family, so you have this large family, how did you guys stay together as a family? I mean, you slept in...', 'And would you all eat together as a family?', \"Oh, so you guys went in shifts, kind of. So tell me, how would, when you didn't, not together, so who would go the first, the first group?\", 'But when you did go to the mess hall, did you try to sit together as a family, though?', 'Because you think people would have, what, maybe tried to hurt you or destroy your property, things like that?', 'Well, how about for the two of you? Did life change when you were in camp? Did you have more time to do different things?', 'So when you hear about things like that, what did you think about the world out there, I mean, Chicago?', 'And so what are some other memories of coming back to Watsonville that you have? I mean, did you see any of your old, like, schoolmates walking around, things like that, and talk to them?', \"I don't know. Why did I move back?\", \"And how large was his family? I'm curious.\", \"1950.

I mean, how would you like it to look like in, say, twenty years from now? What would your hope be?', \"And I'm curious, what kind of questions did they ask? Did you have pictures of the house for them to look at and things like that?\", \"Well, I'm guessing, one question they ask, did they ever ask you if the house was haunted? Did anyone ask that?\", 'Someone asked me that recently: \"is that house haunted?\" [Laughs]', \"Well, so that's the end of my questions. Is there anything else that either one of you would like to talk about in terms of, maybe in terms of, is there anything that you've learned about life? Or when you think of your grandchildren or grand-nieces and nephews, anything that you would want them to know about, about life or values that you think are really important? Maybe something you learned from your mom or your dad?

Were they still living in --', 'During this difficult time, were, do you recall any acts of kindness by people?', 'So there were some people who were friends before the war broke out who remained?', 'Anything else you can recall that really kind of helped you and your family out, an act of kindness?', \"And I'm curious, when they stopped by after the war, do you recall anything they said about what happened and did you guys talk about that?\", 'And you were traveling with, just your wife or with the family?', \"Oh, you were number three, that's right.
