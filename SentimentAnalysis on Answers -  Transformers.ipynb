I progressed from file clerk to the team lead for, I think it was called Team 2 Evaluation or something like that. And basically as the cases were processed through to eligibility and payment, or possibly needed to get sent back to the potential recipient for follow up, for more information, we had a group that would just basically look to verify that the person who was applying had some historical record that we could track them down, whether it was the little index cards that were in our file cabinet, or some of the other documentation that could show that this person was also one of the folks that was listed on one of the camp rosters or one of the little index cards. And we would often look at birth certificates because when they were on the camp roster, they were listed as who were their parents. So if they provided a birth certificate, it had the name and date of birth, and the parents all matched, we were pretty sure we had the right person.': 'NEGATIVE',\n",

And after I got out of school I was working at the beach in the summer, so I went back to the beach because I didn\\'t really have a job lined up. And this was in 1987 when I graduated from college. Then I worked at Macy\\'s, I was in a factory, and then I got a job at a sign company working installing and designing signs. And it didn\\'t pay very well, so at night I was working at Macy\\'s. I met a friend of one of my buddy\\'s dad, who knew a person that worked at Department of Justice and said, \"Hey, I hear of this project that is looking to hire. So I applied for the job and I think I got lucky, and I got the job. I had a funny story, on the way to the job, I was going to meet a friend for lunch and I got a flat. And I had my nice suit from Macy\\'s that I had gotten at a Macy\\'s discount, and I got soaking wet and filthy because it was kind of raining and slushing. By the time I got to the interview, I was way too late to meet my friend for lunch, but I didn\\'t have a cell phone back then, because I had to change a tire. When I got there, the person that was interviewing me noticed how wet I was, and I think that came to my benefit because most people have an excuse for not coming because they had a flat tire. I actually had the flat tire and made it. So just maybe my bad luck of a flat tire was good luck in that I was covered with dirt a little bit.': 'NEGATIVE',\n",

So there were two, sort of, bubble rooms. There were two rooms where you would just have a bunch of desks, maybe kind of like a big conference room. And the office that I shared with Martha Watanabe just was all windows, so we could, I guess, look out on the floor and see who was working and who wasn\\'t, but we never did it that way. But it was just odd to have an office that was all glass that everyone could look in and see what we were doing. But it took me a couple months to fully catch up all the mail to the files. And a lot of times people would send something in and realize, \"Oh, I should have sent additional documentation in.\" But that would be four days behind, and by then, the folder was in the process.': 'NEGATIVE',\n",

But once I caught up, then there was a need for people to help with analysis. So I, for a while, was just an analyst doing it, and then I got to be sort of the team leader. So I would keep track of the stats of what was going through, track all the case numbers that were in my group, and as they would get sent to the next section, we would always kind of know how many we had, where things were going. And then as stuff got tricky, we had a very international crew. So some folks wouldn\\'t feel comfortable calling, so they would give it to me and I would call and say, \"Look, you sent me this particular document, but it doesn\\'t really meet our needs. I\\'m going to send you a request for another document, but please don\\'t send me the same thing that you sent before because the photograph of a headstone isn\\'t the proof that we need that your parent has passed. I need a death certificate.\" So we would just have to... that happened a couple times. I don\\'t mean to make light of it, but we would get a lot of the wrong type of document, or we would get photocopies of stuff.

I guess it was three main payment sections over a certain amount of years, and it was just a humongous rush to get twenty-five or twenty thousand per year. Once we got through that, that was the majority of the folks. I don't remember exactly how many folks were determined eligible and given the formal letter of apology and payment, but I think it was, was it twenty-five thousand per year?\": 'NEGATIVE',\n",

And sometimes we would go to a JACL event, and I would go to these events and I'd have a little booth, and I would have all the forms that you would need to fill out if you wanted to apply for redress. Because we had, I think, a lot more people in the camp rosters that we probably never found out, if maybe they passed away before the act. But as I would go to different events in different cities around the country, I would help people fill out their forms and make sure they knew what documents were acceptable. And in some cases, they would bring the material, they would go home and get it and bring it back, and I could just take it back with me.\": 'NEGATIVE',\n",

Some people filled it out and said, \"I\\'m going to take this money and donate it to a charity, I don\\'t want it for me.\" But I think it was great exposure. Because while we did put a lot of ads in radio, newspaper, and the local communities, having someone at the events, I think...

So an anecdote about it, I know in the beginning there were actuarials that were guessing how many checks would come out and what ages of the people. And as we were approaching the deadline, and I wish I could remember if it was twenty or twenty-five thousand, but whatever it was, we did it by age, because we wanted to make sure that the oldest folks got paid first. Because it was sad, but we would get people that would send in documentation, and then I\\'d follow up and find out that they had passed away. So we wanted to make sure that those folks, the oldest ones would get paid first. And my memory was, when we first started, we thought, okay, we got the first twenty thousand or twenty-five thousand, and the date of birth would be 1924. Anyone born after 1924 will have to wait until the next year. And then another week would go by, and now it\\'s 1923, because we\\'ve gotten so many more processed. And I think it just kept... and the year might not be right, but as the deadline came and we were getting so much, and we were working fifteen, twenty hours a day trying to get everything that we had processed when the final cutoff had to go to Treasury. And we\\'d come running, \"Oh, I got a guy from 1905, get this one in there quick.\" And I just remember that the date just kept going and going and going, and we were just working so hard to make sure that at the end, that we were just looking through \\'em to find anyone who was elderly, pretty old, to make sure that they got in there in time to make the first payment.': 'NEGATIVE',\n",

And I think he might have been a reverend and he spoke at the event. And there's pictures, there were pictures in the newspaper, and I was just honored to be part of this event, it was an amazing event. And even though I was sitting in the last row, it was just great to be part of it. I remember it was in the Justice, I think it was in the main Justice building, so you have to have an ID to get in there. So I got to stand out in front, and as people come in, I can escort them in. People needed, like handicap access, I could take them through the routes that did not involve stairs or in an elevator. So it was a pretty amazing event. And then seeing it in the paper... of course, right afterwards, we got a lot of hate mail. Not a lot, but we got some awful mail.\": 'POSITIVE',\n",

And apparently this one particular person, had multiple homes that they lived in at different times of the year, and I just couldn\\'t track her down because by the time I would get the stuff out to her, she was on to her next address. So it wasn\\'t like you had a cell phone that stuck with you wherever you went. If we couldn\\'t find you at that location, it just took a lot of time. So I remember just over two years or so, trying to get all the paperwork from this particular person. And just a lot of really nice people. I, somewhere, have a folder of thank you notes of people that I spoke to and worked with and then they would send me, to our office, I\\'d be processing the mail and it would come to me.

And I read that before coming to the job, and that was my... I looked it up in an encyclopedia, too, but what really impacted me more and gave me more information about it than an encyclopedia entry was the story of a girl getting kind of ripped up from her friends and not quite understanding why she had to go to this place.

And I think in Sacramento he was doing that, too. He tried a little business like tofu-ya, making tofu or something like that, and that didn't go, didn't take. But when we came to Los Angeles, he was managing a hotel. And then he ended up having a small vegetable and fruit stand on Western Avenue, I remember that. And the funny, main thing I remember about that experience was that instead of the cash register, he used to use the soroban, the abacus, to calculate purchase and change that he had to give the customer. And it just fascinated me that he preferred to use the abacus rather than the cash register. [Laughs]\": 'NEGATIVE',\n",

But he, unfortunately, because of the language barrier, I didn\\'t communicate with him too much. He knew English, he spoke some English, he read a lot of English, but he didn\\'t communicate in English very much.

She was... and of course because the economic situation being so poor in the \\'30s, early \\'30s and all, she didn\\'t make time or take time to learn English. So, of course, that\\'s one of my biggest regrets, that my relationship with my mother was so brief in terms of our being able to communicate. I fault myself a great deal for not appreciating my mother more by not embracing the opportunity to learn Japanese. So I keep thinking now, even this late day when I\\'m pushing eighty-five years old, how was I able to communicate and develop any kind of relationship with my mother when we hardly talked? We did the best we could with her poor English, with my poor Japanese. But she was a devoted mother. And so, always so kind, sweet and gentle. Loved music, she was a good shamisen player, she played the koto, she loved to dance the odori, mostly Bon Odori during the summer months.

There were a lot of Japanese American families there. So I didn't feel that great a difference in terms of discomfort. It's just making new friends, you know how kids are.

That\\'s when I started to feel -- I think that\\'s when most of us young folks feel that when we start thinking about maybe dating or \"going steady,\" you know, that\\'s when usually the parents of the white girl or boy might object.

And then we would have a lot of baseball games, competing with other girls\\' teams, or once in a while, maybe competing against boys\\' teams. And they were scattered. I\\'m sure there were groups like that in San Pedro. I know there were several different groups in Los Angeles. I belonged to a group called the Junior Misses, and there were about a dozen of us. And we would, quote, \"sponsor\" dances just as an excuse to be able to meet the boys or have little bake sales. Any excuse to try to reach out and meet other people. Our group was concentrated in the uptown area. There was another group, young girls, called, I think, Debutantes, that was in the Crenshaw/Senshin area. And then there were boys\\' groups called Mustangs, Cougars, the Knights, K-N-I-G-H-T-S, and they would compete mostly baseball, sometimes basketball, volleyball. So that was... and then in the church, we would have Japanese language school, that was another occasion for us to be able to have co-ed activities. I belonged to the St. Mary\\'s Episcopal Church, and as I recall, on Saturdays, we had Japanese language school, which I resisted terribly. Because during those days, not like today... today, you walk down the street, you can hear all kinds of languages, and people don\\'t, you know, don\\'t think twice about it. But during those days, you open your mouth and you spoke Japanese, you got dirty looks.

As a matter of fact, I think when we went into the camps, they would refer to each other as yogores. I\\'m not sure how you translate that in English, it means... yogore, of course, means \"dirty boys.\" But anyway, there was not too much love lost, I heard.

My family was rather musical starting with my mother. And I don't know how they ever managed to pay for those classes. Because as I recall, we were always very poor, and I'm not sure how easy it was for my father to even come up with the rent for the house. And so when I think back, and they allowed me to take piano lessons and all these dance (classes), I wondered how much sacrifice they made to enable me to do that.

My brother played, my oldest brother played the violin very well. Aya did the piano, she always played Christian hymns, and Johnny was a good musician. Oh, my sister Ei also played a mean ukulele.

John, Jr. followed in his father's footsteps. And then I think they called him Father John, but that was after the camps. So I never got to get to know the younger minister. But it provided a sanctuary for the community, and a place for the Japanese community to meet regularly on Sunday.

I guess they were afraid of being considered \"Jap lovers,\" and the longer the period went after the war, that gap was, got bigger, and more people would react like they would rather not be close to us, if they were non-Japanese.

Not being able to just walk out to the corner drugstore, get an ice cream soda, or the privacy, not being able to change your clothes when you wanted to. Of course, we all put up little partitions later, as you know. (...) We had three different families in one room. The guys put up slats and then put a blanket, nailed a blanket to separate our living quarters.

Washing three dozen diapers a day in a tub with a washboard, like there's no washing machine. For the pregnant woman like me, the food was not the best, I think. So I think most of the children who were born in camps like my daughter, had, at least the first growing up period, they were not really healthy. They didn't have the immune system developed that worked in if we had had better food. The hospital was run by a doctor, who I heard later on, not at that time, but later, from people who worked in the hospital, that the white doctor was an alcoholic. And most of the work was done by Nisei nurses or some Nisei doctors, who, as you know, were paid the highest wage. Was it nineteen dollars a month? Oh, boy. Teachers, doctors, nineteen dollars a month, to do the kind of hard, hard work that was required. And I don't know, not having associated myself with hospital facilities, if they were, had the kind of equipment or supplies that a normal outside hospital would have had. I know in the case of my father, in Jerome, when I went to, transferred to Jerome, there (weren't) enough flashlights. For example, the night before he died, Christmas Eve of 1943, he had an oxygen tank to keep him alive, and we were not permitted to light candles or something because of the danger of explosion, and the electricity was out.

So in terms of that hospital, they didn\\'t have enough equipment, so I suppose most of the hospitals were the same. As for the care, I think when I gave birth to my daughter, it was, we didn\\'t have separate rooms. It was like a regular barrack, we all slept next to each other. And I guess I must have just thought, well, I\\'m lucky to have a hospital in which the baby was born. Nowadays, I think that women who give birth are asked to leave the hospital two or three days after birth. At that time, it was standard procedure that the new mother stayed in the hospital for a week, and that was what it was.

Whereas when we first went to Manzanar, everything was in a state of flux, we're trying to get used to our own environment, jobs were not available for people who just had nothing to do. By the time we got to Jerome, things were pretty much (like) the experience of Manzanar and other camps that were opened earlier, (which) taught the Jerome administration what to do, what not to do. So I think it was working pretty smoothly. And there were the regular Buddhist or church services, so that the residents of the camps felt more at ease than the first group of people like in Manzanar when I first went there. It was such a new environment, and the people in Jerome had come from other assembly centers like my parents were in Santa Anita first.

And, of course, many, many years later, I became very friendly with Harry Ueno, who was supposed to be the catalyst for that particular disturbance. But in Jerome, I think, to show the difference, Jerome had only one dissident camp resister, Joe Yamakido, whereas Manzanar had more, and, of course, Heart Mountain had a lot, and Granada had more.

And I was working to take speeches at conventions, or get hired out from this institute to a letter shop, where I would be rehired by, say, lawyers who worked in that building to take dictation and do temporary work. That was the first time I had direct experience with a guy. I went with my stenotype instrument, walked into his office, and he looked at me and he said, \"Are you the temporary secretary?\" I said, \"Yeah.\" \"Are you Japanese?\" \"Yeah, my parents are from Japan.\" \"I don\\'t want you. Tell your boss to send me someone else, not Japanese.\" I was shocked. I had never had somebody tell me right to face, because I\\'m Japanese, \"I\\'m not going to use you.\" Didn\\'t know what I could do, what I couldn\\'t do. I was really devastated at that. Well, I took this course and I graduated, so I got some work as a court reporter, but I never had to go to court.

So my actual contact with the Japanese people was pretty limited mostly to my housemaids, the gardener, and just a few Japanese friends. Because of the restrictions, I didn't get a chance to really, I didn't take advantage of it. Maybe I could have done more, to even learn the language.

I compare that with the European countries that were so negatively affected by World War II, how long it took them to come up from all this devastation, and how quickly the Japanese did.

I was on a television show with, I think Norman Mineta was one of the panel members. But there was a congressman, Norman Shumway from California, who was on the screen. He couldn\\'t appear at the studio, but they got him on the screen. We were talking about the redress bill that was being debated, and he said, what comes back to me all the time to show how the, at least Congress was viewing the redress bill. He said, \"If you think for one moment that this bill, redress bill, which calls for 1.2 billion dollars, (...) is going to make any difference in the way the government will react in times of emergency such as after Pearl Harbor, that we have to take action against a potential enemy, you think it\\'s going to make any difference that the government will not pick up a group of, say, misfits or ethnic group, then you\\'re barking up the wrong tree. Don\\'t kid yourself.\" He says, \"We spend more than a billion dollars every day, every minute, every hour,\" he said. \"So this isn\\'t going to make a dent.\" I was furious with him when he said that, but it turned out to be the truth. When the war broke out after 9/11 and this country started picking on Arab Americans just because they were Arab Americans, ooh, shades of deja vu. We didn\\'t learn anything. And what made me think was, okay, if Hohri vs. U.S., the class-action lawsuit that would cost the government, the treasury, 27 billion dollars, if we had passed that, would this country have remembered? I\\'m wondering whether or not the bottom line on this in this country is always the almighty dollar. Yes, we got an apology, a letter of apology from Bush and Clinton, and twenty thousand dollars per survivor. But Congress, even the new members of Congress (today) don\\'t know anything about it. We didn\\'t make a dent, we didn\\'t affect how this country was looking at Arab Americans after 9/11. So I\\'m thinking, what do we have to do to make Americans aware? The only thing I see, the plus in our experience, is that now some of the stories of the 442 Regimental Combat Team, our exclusion, incarceration, will be in the history books. Maybe that\\'s a start. But, well, jiminy, it\\'s how many years since this happened, and we still, you know, don\\'t know enough, and we repeated the same mistake when 9/11 happened.

In our family, my father, as a matter of fact, destroyed all of his Japanese language books because rumors spread that if the FBI came to your home and found Japanese language books, your father or uncle, or mother would be taken away and fear just gripped the community over things like that. My father destroyed almost all of his Japanese language books, including a book that he had written -- he had a number of copies of a autobiography my sister said he had written. Also, he had been carrying around the ashes of one of my sisters, a half-sister, and my mother told me many, many years later that he had buried those ashes in the backyard of our home in Los Angeles. She didn't know where, what part of the yard. I've often thought of going back to that house, but I didn't know how to approach the occupant of the house to ask if I could dig up his backyard to look for the ashes of my sister my father had buried fifty years ago. [Laughs] So I've never done it. But I've passed in front of the house a couple of times, and wondered what could I do.\": 'NEGATIVE',\n",
       " \"I'm not sure. You know, I think that he thought perhaps -- she was born in Japan -- and I have a feeling he had hoped one day to take her ashes back to Japan. Either that or he was waiting for, to get settled someplace, in say, southern California, where he could feel, this is where we're going to set our roots, place our roots, and perhaps get our family plot, and bury her there. But I have a feeling it was that he was planning to take her ashes back to Japan.\": 'NEGATIVE',\n",
       " 'Oh, all right. Many families owned their homes, so they had a lot more problems in terms of their economic situation and property. We were so poor, we didn\\'t own the home, we were renting, so that, that was not as big a problem for us. Our problem was what to take, what to destroy, what to sell. And the neighbors, the persons, the non-Japanese who were not moving, being asked to move, knew that the shorter time we had to leave, the more willing we would be to lower our prices. So there were \"vultures\" all around, hanging around for days, waiting for the day that we would move, and that we would literally have to give things away. My mother, of course, had some small items, beautiful little dishes from Japan, and I think some heirlooms that she decided to sell -- brooches, obitome -- things like that that I, I know that she had to get rid of, to sell, because she felt we must take what is absolutely necessary as long as we were permitted to take only what we could carry, at the time. And I have heard many stories of mothers who were so furious at the insulting prices that were offered by buyers, that they rather, rather than sell them at these prices, they would break the dishes or the big platters that they cherished so much. I believe those who left for the camps early on did not have the opportunity, or the knowledge at the time, or the permission by the government, that they could store some things. That kind of information came later on and those who moved into these army-run assembly centers later on, say, June, July, they were told that they could store some things. So many of those families were able to keep household goods, furnitures, where those of us who left very early could not do that. I myself -- yes?': 'NEGATIVE',\n",

       " 'Okay. When I was going to high school -- this was Los Angeles High School -- we lived during that time in a very hostile environment, hostile to ethnic Japanese. There was a strong feeling of hostility against people of Japanese ancestry. Therefore, we had difficulties going, buying homes in certain areas, and this anti-Japanese feeling carried itself over into school. When the war broke out, after Pearl Harbor, as a matter of fact I think it was about a month after Pearl Harbor, I was reminded by one of my classmates a few years ago who came up to me and he said, \"Don\\'t you remember that Principal So-and-so called us\" -- we, of Japanese ancestry, who are ready to graduate that summer -- \"called us into his office and said, \\'All of you don\\'t deserve to graduate. Your people bombed Pearl Harbor.\\'\" We were in a state of shock. He said, \"Don\\'t you remember?\" I think I pushed that in the back of my mind and just tried to forget it. He had never forgotten it. He was bitter all these years, this friend of mine. The Japanese American students tried their best to be the best citizens, worked two hundred percent harder than everybody else, because we were always under scrutiny, disliked, so we were out to prove that we were just as good, if not better than the quote, \"mainstream\" students.': 'POSITIVE',\n",

We were able to reach the pinnacle of scholarly success for high school students by becoming members of the California Scholarship Federation, which was quite a thing at the time. And all of us worked very hard to be good students, to be good citizens. Therefore, after working for twelve years to reach the top of the mountain to graduate, after having lived through and in this hostile environment, then to have our high school principal talk to us like that was, in Hayawa Shishino's mind, the most devastating experience of his life, and his bitterness has carried him over all these, with him all these years. I know that I was really disappointed and devastated to think that I wouldn't be able to graduate and wear a cap and gown with all my other Caucasian friends. And to be deprived of those, of that diploma which we worked so hard for was a big blow to us. It was proof that the feeling we had been carrying all the time, sort a self-hatred for not being white, showed its, showed its ugly face and ugly head at that time. I think that I may not be alone in saying that I grew up with a certain amount of self-hatred, I could never be Betty Grable, I hated not to be blond, I hated not to, to enjoy the kind of attention that blonds got. And this school incident was another example of why we had the self-hatred, why it stayed with, remained with us through our lives.\": 'NEGATIVE',\n",
       " 'Yes. Oh, fortunate, wonderful. Mr. Shishino took steps, although it was forty-something, almost fifty years afterwards. He wrote, after all those years, after those decades, he wrote to the Los Angeles Board of Education and complained about the treatment he and our fifteen other members of our class received during the summer of 1942. And fortunately there was a young Japanese American on the Board of Education at that time, who took his complaint and his grievance seriously. He discussed the situation with other members of the Board of Education of Los Angeles and made arrangements to have a wonderful ceremony for those who were, who still survived from the, that class of summer 1942 in Los Angeles High School, and had a wonderful ceremony in Los Angeles High School for those of us who are now grandparents and great-grandparents. And oh, the funny part of this whole thing was that the member of the Board of Education whom Mr. Shishino contacted was my son-in-law. So he, when my son-in-law found out that I was a member of the class, of course, he made a special effort to make sure that this happened. And so we were presented our 1942 diplomas in 1989, I think it was. And that seemed to have set a trend, because I know that after that, other cities up and down the West Coast did the same thing. And even UC Berkeley, I think, two years ago, had a ceremony, and UCLA, a ceremony to honor those who would have gotten their degrees, or who were dishonored at that time and the school wanted to make up for it. So it turned out to be a lot of fun for those of us who were now grandparents to be receiving our high school diplomas.': 'POSITIVE',\n",

Since we were not told exactly where we would go, it was hard to decide, do we take summer clothes, winter clothes? Sneakers, boots, or what? So I found what few things I selected were totally inadequate for the kind of weather that we finally did encounter when we went into camp. At the time, I mentioned to you a little while ago, that I was engaged to a young Nisei who lived on the other side of town. We found out that the persons living in the area where he lived would be going to a particular assembly center, whereas my family would be going somewhere else. And so foolishly, and desperately in love, we eloped, so I could go with his family. That is what I did. So I ended up in a camp called Manzanar where my parents did not move for another month or month and a half, they did not go to the same camp. They went to another camp called Santa Anita. It was a horse racetrack, and it was a pretty miserable situation in which they found themselves. Not that Manzanar camp was much better, but it was at least not horse stables.': 'NEGATIVE',\n",

Then I was too busy in camp. Here I was seventeen years old and a year later I became a mother in camp. I had my first child in camp, so busy learning how to be a mother when I hadn't yet grown up myself, so...

An area between the towns of Independence and Lone Pine in the eastern half, sort of north, not too far from the border of Nevada, in northern California. The day we arrived was hot, dusty. When we got off the bus we were, we lined up and were told which barrack we should go to, to leave our suitcases, then told to go to a certain area where we were issued a sack, long sack which served as the mattress cover, told to fill it with hay, which was, served as our mattress for the period that we were in the camps.

It was just barren, sagebrush-filled area. And it was so depressing. I think the parents, the Issei, were happy to be there simply because at least they were together with their family and they weren't separated from their children. And I must say, many of the Issei had some free time for the first time. They didn't have to worry about getting up at the crack of dawn, farming, or running stores and they did have some free time. But I think they also lost their liberty which to me was one of the biggest deprivations that we suffered those three or four years. Loss of liberty was something I felt very, very strongly.\": 'NEGATIVE',\n",

And when you have to cook for so many people, I don\\'t think you can ever expect real delicious food, unless you go to a fancy restaurant. Now this was a situation in which each camp prided itself, prided itself -- is that right English? -- on how little they spent for each resident. They would report back to the government in Washington, \"We only spent 49 cents per person in our camp.\" Some camps would be bragging they only spent 35 cents. So you could tell the quality of the food was not good just by that, the price, virtue alone. And of course, there were a lot of problems with people stealing from the mess halls.': 'NEGATIVE',\n",

I think I remember memorizing what page the chocolate candies were on in the Sears Roebuck catalog. What page the diapers were on, or the, all those necessary things were, in the Montgomery Ward catalogue. We bought diapers -- during those days there were no Pampers or Huggies. We bought diapers through the catalog. Baby clothes, layettes. Of course, it was something. I remember going through these books and thinking well, this costs three dollars, we only get sixteen dollars. How much of that -- what do we have left for the rest of the month? Fortunately, we didn\\'t have to pay rent, or buy our meals, but everything still cost the same for us as for people who lived outside of the camps and they were making a hundred dollars a week -- or maybe not that much -- a hundred dollars a month as opposed to what we were making, sixteen dollars a month. It wasn\\'t easy. I remember being pregnant and saying, \"I\\'ve got to have this box of chocolate,\" and order it, wait for two or three weeks, anticipating every day a box of chocolate, and then a notice coming, saying, \"Sorry, we\\'re out of stock.\" I remember crying and crying when that happened.

I don\\'t know why I was looking all over the place.\" I managed to understand that much of what he was trying to tell me. And he, he went rather peacefully.

And I thought, \"Here\\'s this Christian man, what is he doing, coming out with this Buddhist chant?\" It was some childhood memory surfaced, either that or he, he believed that we all, regardless of what religion, we all worship a god and that no matter what house of worship you go to, whether it be Buddhist, Catholic, Protestant, that we are just taking different roads to the same destination.

They would rather commit suicide than to be taken prisoners or surrender, which meant America would not have many prisoners of war, American -- Japanese prisoners of war, soldiers or sailors. Whereas Japan already had quite a pool of American citizens who were interned by Imperial Japan. Now, international conventions call for the exchange of prisoners. Here Japan had this huge pool of American citizens, America would not have any prisoners, Japanese prisoners. So if Issei and Nisei -- from the West Coast primarily, because that's where most of the Japanese American community was congregated -- were placed in a holding situation where they could easily be exchanged, picked up and exchanged for American prisoners, that made the situation easier for the State Department to deal with if we were all already in one area. And there are documents in the archives that imply the fact that now this government does have a population of Japanese, ethnic Japanese, on whom reprisals can be taken if Imperial Japan mistreats American soldiers, or American civilians who were interned. There are these documents and Michi Weglyn had discovered them. So it makes a lot of sense to me. So we were hostages. Hostages for exchange purposes or possible, at least threatened, reprisals.

Of course, that\\'s all handwritten, so I think that\\'s how... \\'cause she was born in June of 1941, and they said you have to be born... so she had to alter six months earlier. So like end of \\'40, or something to do with the war, bombing was done in \\'41? Was it, Pearl Harbor was December, right? So you could not be in that year. It was, I don\\'t remember, but it was something that you have to be a year before, something like that. And so she had to alter, and then she came on her... my mother had U.S. passport, so she came on her passport.

And the whole family came, and she had, they had no problem. But I think her father was, had somehow with the U.S. government connection. But they were also in those repatriation act or whatever, that the U.S. granted the people with U.S. citizen the right to return to America. And so my mother was born, so she was one of those. And they were, they were some of her, a few of her high school classmates, that they were born in America and they were all, like, sent to Okinawa to go to school. They came, and I believe there were three or four ships. And my mother was second from the last ship, so I don\\'t know if that\\'s second or third ship that she came. And, but they were mostly, they were all to Hawaii. But, except for one... yeah, some people came to San Francisco, from Hawaii to San Francisco, but I don\\'t know how that ship worked. But they were, that\\'s how my mother and my sister came to Hawaii. And they lived in Kauai with the grandparents a little, and then my mother went to Honolulu to work.

But other than that, I didn\\'t really feel anything. They would get me a lot of magazines and things like that, and then my grandfather was able to read English. So he would translate a lot of those golden books that we had, Cinderella and those. So he would tell me all the, read me all these books telling me, tell the stories in Japanese. So, and so a lot of... I think a lot of those magazines might have been things that we picked up in U.S. dumps. [Laughs] \\'Cause we did have, like, National Geographics and those children\\'s books, U.S. books. And yeah, whatever books that we can find. And, of course, after, when we were going to school, lot of Japanese children\\'s magazines were out. You know, they would buy \\'em and those things.

But he came back from the war, and I don't remember being really, you know, injured, but I know he was going through depression. He used to drink a lot.

So the lady was telling my grandmother, \"I\\'m bringing them so that they can emotionally and just physically rest and enjoy their day.\" So that\\'s... and then sort of the way they talk about what they, what this person was like, this man was like.

And again, the candies, too, she would open a package and all separate. And so, \"This is gonna go to them.\" And anytime somebody would come, and eventually we would be eating -- it was the Kisses, Kisses chocolate, were the most chocolate that they had sent, and it was much easier to eat. But we save it so preciously, sometimes it gets molded, and we still ate molded chocolate, mold and all.

And she was, she had a casualty from the war. She had no nose, so she always wore bandages. And my mother, I think my grandmother probably requested some bandage from Hawaii. So I remember when she got it, she would be taking to her, or she would get it from some friends that would take it to her so she can change as often as possible. And then, shortly after, there was next, our village sonchou's wife, was apparently working in the ryotei or had a little bit more formal dancing experience. So I started learning from her. But, of course, only opportunity we would get to dance was like parties, or they would have a, they would make a stage, each village would make a stage and they would have a full program during the Obon or something like that, so I would get to dance. But, you know, the costume and things that we would have is scrap from a U.S. military parachute or like gloves converted to tabi, and kimono was maybe somebody's kimono taken apart to make children's kimono. And fan was made from Christmas wrapping paper that we would find in the dump. And bamboo, we had a lot, so somebody would use bamboo screw, and they would glue fans.

They used to have, carve it out of ivory, but I don't think you can have ivory now, so ivory or they would be using goat's horn. In fact, I have that and I have the ivory one. Or now maybe the plastic mold might be... but it's something that you put on your finger and you pluck it with that. And Japanese one is with that, this kind of shape, almost like shamoji.

Or sometimes you rub that and mix it with shiquasa, a little lime, and then, and then put it on your finger. So that way, the color stays longer. So that\\'s how we used to color.

It's something to calm themselves, and you know, so it was, it was on the part of these performance artists that used that as, to help people. So, in fact, the Majikina school that I'm studying, studied under, that Majikina, the father, Yuko Sensei, the headmaster, was one of those people who had that theater. And, of course, his daughters were all in dancing, so the family would be performing the whole theater. The dance, plus the kumiudui, doing plays, and all those whole evening's entertainment.

And maybe stage was plywood just put together, and sometimes there's a hole all over the place, or, yeah, plywood probably from the ruin of homes or something like that, that was just put there. And you just sat there and just enjoyed, 'cause there's no, of course, no TV, no radio, and that was your whole entertainment. And like Obon season, each village would put their own show, where young people would do something special, they worked through whole year, and then they have like eisa, each village would have that.

This nurse came, and she was a weekend nurse and a lovely young lady, and she said, \"Mrs. Kato, are you from Elnor Apartments?\" My mother said, \"Well, yes.\" She identified herself, she said, \"I want thank you so much for all those lovely Japanese things that you gave us.\" She says, \"We have treasured them, my mother and I have treasured them so much.\" And she says, \"My daughter\\'s getting married in June, and I\\'m giving her the nice silk kimono and the nice plates that you gave us.\" My mother looked at me, and they had these beautiful dolls in the cases and everything, and my mother looked at me and I looked at her.

At least somebody\\'s treasured them and taken good care of them and still honoring them.\" And she got very pleased, because so many people had things destroyed just because they were Japanese. And at least these were treasured, and so that was very nice. And so, we, I must say that we have been fortunate in not having the real tragedies that so many people had undergone in camp.
